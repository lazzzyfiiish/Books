## HOW GRAMMAR CHANGES

If you think that grammar is an exact science, get ready for a shock. Grammar is a science, all right—but it is most inexact. There are no inflexible laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no unchanging principles. Correctness varies with the times and depends much more on geography, on social class, and on collective human caprice than on the restrictions found in textbooks.

In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make ten the country over—in the North, in the South, in the West; in Los Angeles and Coral Gables and New York. There are no two opinions on the matter—we are dealing, so far as we know, with a universal and indisputable fact.

In grammar, however, since the facts are highly susceptible to change, we have to keep an eye peeled for trends. What are educated people saying these days? Which expressions are generally used and accepted on educated levels, which others are more or less restricted to the less educated levels of speech? The answers to these questions indicate the trend of usage in the United States, and if such trends come in conflict with academic rules, then the rules are no longer of any great importance.

_Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated people—not the other way around._ That is the important point to keep in mind.

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intendedto help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinions given following the test.

#### TEST YOURSELF

&#x20; 1\. Let’s keep this between you and _I._

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 2\. I’m your best friend, _ain’t_ I?

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 3\. Five and five _is_ ten.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 4\. I never saw a man get so _mad._

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 5\. Every one of his sisters _are_ unmarried.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 6\. He visited an _optometrist_ for an eye operation.

&#x20; 7\. Do you _prophecy_ another world war?

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 8\. _Leave_ us not mention it.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 9\. If you expect to _eventually succeed_, you must keep trying.

RIGHT      WRONG

1\. Let’s keep this between you and _I._

WRONG. Children are so frequently corrected by parents and teachers when they say _me_ that they cannot be blamed if they begin to think that this simple syllable is probably a naughty word. Dialogues such as the following are certainly typical of many households.

“Mother, can me and Johnnie go out and play?”

“No, dear, not until you say it correctly. You mean ‘May Johnnie and I go out to play?’ ”

“Who wants a jelly apple?”

“Me!”

“Then use the proper word.”

(The child becomes a little confused at this point—there seem to be so many “proper” and “improper” words.)

“Me, _please!_”

“No, dear, not _me._”

“Oh. _I_, please?”

(This sounds terrible to a child’s ear. It completely violates his sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudgingly conforms.)

“Who broke my best vase?”

“It wasn’t me!”

“Is that good English, Johnnie?”

“Okay, it wasn’t I. But honest, Mom, it wasn’t me—I didn’t even touch it!”

And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is safer to say _I._

Some adults, conditioned in childhood by the kind of misguided censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that “between you and _I_” is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated speakers, obeying the rule that a preposition governs the objective pronoun, say “between you and _me._”

2\. I’m your best friend, _ain’t_ I?

WRONG. As linguistic scholars have frequently pointed out, it is unfortunate that _ain’t I?_ is unpopular in educated speech, for the phrase fills a long-felt need. _Am I not?_ is too prissy for down-to-earth people; _amn’t I?_ is ridiculous; and _aren’t I_, though popular in England, has never really caught on in America. With a sentence like the one under discussion you are practically in a linguistic trap—there is no way out unless you are willing to choose between appearing illiterate, sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous.

“What is the matter with _ain’t I?_ for _am I not?_” language scholar Wallace Rice once wrote. “Nothing whatever, save that a number of minor grammarians object to it. _Ain’t I?_ has a pleasant sound once the ears are unstopped of prejudice.” Mr. Rice has a valid point there, yet educated people avoid _ain’t I?_ as if it were catching. In all honesty, therefore, I must say to you: don’t use _ain’t I?_, except humorously. What is a safe substitute? Apparently none exists, so I suggest that you manage, by some linguistic calisthenics, to avoid having to make a choice. Otherwise you may findyourself in the position of being damned if you do and damned if you don’t.

3\. Five and five _is_ ten.

RIGHT. But don’t jump to the conclusion that “five and five _are_ ten” is wrong—both verbs are equally acceptable in this or any similar construction. If you prefer to think of “five-and-five” as a single mathematical concept, say _is._ If you find it more reasonable to consider “five and five” a plural idea, say _are._ The teachers I’ve polled on this point are about evenly divided in preference, and so, I imagine, are the rest of us. Use whichever verb has the greater appeal to your sense of logic.

4\. I never saw a man get so _mad._

RIGHT. When I questioned a number of authors and editors about their opinion of the acceptability of _mad_ as a synonym for _angry_, the typical reaction was: “Yes, I say _mad_, but I always feel a little guilty when I do.”

Most people do say _mad_ when they are sure there is no English teacher listening; it’s a good sharp word, everybody understands exactly what it means, and it’s a lot stronger than _angry_, though not quite as violent as _furious_ or _enraged._ In short, _mad_ has a special implication offered by no other word in the English language; as a consequence, educated people use it as the occasion demands and it is perfectly correct. So correct, in fact, that every authoritative dictionary lists it as a completely acceptable usage. If you feel guilty when you say _mad_, even though you don’t mean _insane_, it’s time you stopped plaguing your conscience with trivialities.

5\. Every one of his sisters _are_ unmarried.

WRONG. _Are_ is perhaps the more logical word, since the sentence implies that he has more than one sister and they are all unmarried. In educated speech, however, the tendency is to make the verb agree with the subject, even if logic is violated in the process—and the better choice here would be _is_, agreeing with the singular subject, _every one._

6\. He visited an _optometrist_ for an eye operation.

WRONG. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an operation, he went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are forbidden by law to perform surgery or administer drugs—theymay only prescribe and fit glasses. And they are not medical doctors. The M.D. who specializes in the treatment of eye diseases, and who may operate when necessary, is an _ophthalmologist._ (See Chapter 4.)

7\. Do you _prophecy_ another world war?

WRONG. Use _prophecy_ only when you mean _prediction_, a noun. When you mean _predict_, a verb, as in this sentence, use _prophesy._ This distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly say: “His _prophecy_ (_prediction_) turned out to be true,” but “He really seems able to _prophesy_ (_predict_) political trends.” There is a distinction also in the pronunciation of these two words. _Prophecy_ is pronounced PROF′-Ə-see; _prophesy_ is pronunced PROF′-Ə-sī′.

8\. _Leave_ us not mention it.

WRONG. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech, _leave_ is a popular substitute for _let._ On educated levels, the following distinction is carefully observed: _let_ means _allow; leave_ means _depart._ (There are a few idiomatic exceptions to this rule, but they present no problem.) “_Let_ me go” is preferable to “_Leave_ me go” even on the most informal of occasions, and a sentence like “_Leave_ us not mention it” is not considered standard English.

9\. If you expect to _eventually succeed_, you must keep trying.

RIGHT. We have here, in case you’re puzzled, an example of that notorious bugbear of academic grammar, the “split infinitive.” (An infinitive is a verb preceded by _to: to succeed, to fail, to remember._)

Splitting an infinitive is not at all difficult—you need only insert a word between the _to_ and the verb: _to eventually succeed, to completely fail, to quickly remember._

Now that you know how to split an infinitive, the important question is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to you that it is not only legal, it is also ethical, moral, and sometimes more effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, among many others, were unconscionable infinitive splitters. And modern writers are equally partial to the construction.

To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of editors about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two typical reactions.

An editor at Doubleday and Company: “The restriction against the split infinitive is, to my mind, the most artificial of all grammatical rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives regularly in their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing when they rewrite and polish their material.”

An editor at _Reader’s Digest:_ “I want to defend the split infinitive. The construction adds to the strength of the sentence—it’s compact and clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive whenever I can catch one.”

And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as quoted by Rudolf Flesch in _The Art of Plain Talk:_ “Word has somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This is of a piece with the outworn notion that it is always wrong to strike a lady.”

I think the evidence is conclusive enough—it is perfectly correct to consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases the strength or clarity of your sentence.
