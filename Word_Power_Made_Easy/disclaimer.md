# Disclaimer:

Occasionally in these pages, owing to the deficiency of the English language, I have used _he/him/his_ meaning _he or she/him or her/his or her_ in order to avoid awkwardness of style.

_He, him_, and _his_ are _not_ intended as exclusively masculine pronounsâ€”they may refer to either sex or to both sexes.
