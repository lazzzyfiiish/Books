# How to Use This Book for Maximum Benefit

**1. this is not a reading book…**

_Don’t read this book!_

Instead, _work_ with it. _Talk aloud_ to it, _talk back_ to it—use your voice, not just your eyes and mind.

Learning, _real learning_, goes on only through _active participation._

When a new word occurs in a chapter, _say it aloud!_ (The phonetic respelling will help you pronounce it correctly.)<sup>1</sup>

When you do the matching exercises, keep track of your responses. (Check the key that immediately follows each exercise.)

When you do the “Yes-No,” “True-False,” or “Same-Opposite” exercises, keep track of your responses, then check with the key when you have completed the whole exercise.

When you are asked to fill in words that fit definitions, _write your answers on a piece of paper;_ then check the key both to see if you have responded with the right word and also to make sure your spelling is correct.

When you do the _Review of Etymology_ exercises, make sure to fill in the English word containing the prefix, root, or suffix required—use a chapter word, or any other word that comes to mind. (Coin words if you like!)

Pay special attention to the _Chapter Reviews._ Are the words still fresh in your mind? Do you remember the meaning of each root studied in the previous sessions? In these _Reviews_, you are not only testing your learning but also tightening up any areas in which you discover lacks, weaknesses, or lapses of memory.

**2. master the pronunciation system!**

Saying words _aloud_, and saying them _right_, is half the battle in feeling comfortable and assured with all the new words you are going to learn. Every word taught is respelled to show its pronunciation, so pay close attention to how the phonetic symbols work.

(a) _First, master the “schwa”!_

Almost every English word of two or more syllables contains one or several syllables in which the vowel sound is said _very_ quickly. For example:

“_Linda_ spoke to her _mother about_ a _different idea_ she had.”\
→Read the _previous sentence aloud_ at _normal conversational_ speed.

Read it again. Listen to how the -_a_ of _Linda;_ the -_er_ of _mother;_ the _a_- of _about;_ the -_er_ and -_ent_ of _different;_ and the -_a_ of _idea_ sound.

Very quick—very short! Right?

Phonetically respelled, these words are represented as:

|   1. _Linda_     | LIN′-dƏ                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   2. _mother_    | MU![](blob:moz-extension://95c76d74-e490-4d6a-85ca-b2d3597fcaba/837ab2c3-a5e9-43d4-b0e4-aca0bf55ff50)′-Ər |
|   3. _about_     | Ə-BOWT′                                                                                                   |
|   4. _different_ | DIF′-Ər-Ənt                                                                                               |
|   5. _idea_      | ī-DEE′-Ə                                                                                                  |

The symbol “Ə,” called a _schwa_, represents the quick, short vowel sound in the five words above.

Now look back at the sentence preceded by an arrow.

The italicized words are rewritten as:

|   1. _previous_       | PREE′-vee-Əs          |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
|   2. _sentence_       | SEN′-tƏns             |
|   3. _aloud_          | Ə-LOWD′               |
|   4. _normal_         | NAWR′-mƏl             |
|   5. _conversational_ | kon′-vƏr-SAY′-shƏn-Əl |

You will find Ə in almost all words that are phonetically respelled throughout this book. Say the five italicized words aloud and make sure you understand how the _schwa_ (Ə) sounds.

(b) _Next, understand accent._

Look at word (5) above: _conversational:_ kon′-vƏr-SAY′-shƏn-Əl. Note that there are _two_ accent marks, one on _kon′_, another on _SAY′._ Note also that _kon′_ is in lower-case letters, _SAY′_ in capitals. Both syllables are stressed, but the one in capitals (_SAY′_) sounds stronger (or louder) than the one in lower case (_kon′_). Say _conversational_ aloud, noting the difference.

Say these three words, taken from Chapter 3, _aloud_, noticing the variation in stress between the lower-case and the capitalized syllables:

|   1. _egomaniacal_     | ee′-gō-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
|   2. _altercation_     | awl′-tƏr-KAY′-shƏn     |
|   3. _anthropological_ | an′-thrƏ-pƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl |

(c) _Be careful of the letter “S”_ (_or “s”_) _in phonetic respellings. S_ (or _s_) is always _hissed_, as in _see, some, such._ After an -_n_, you will be tempted to _buzz_ (or “voice”) the -_s_, because final -_ns_ is usually pronounced -_nz_, as in _wins, tons, owns_, etc. (Say these three words aloud—hear the _z_ at the end?) _Resist the temptation! S_ (or _s_) is _always hissed_ in phonetic respellings!

Say these words aloud:

|   1. _ambivalence_<sup>2</sup> | am-BIV′-Ə-lƏns |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
|   2. _affluence_               | AF′-l-Əns      |
|   3. _opulence_                | OP′-yƏ-lƏns    |
|   4. _sentence_                | SEN′-tƏns      |

(d) The symbol _ī_ or _Ī_ is pronounced _eye_, to rhyme with _high, sigh, my_, etc., _no matter where you find it._ For example:

|   1. _fights_   | FĪTS        |
| --------------- | ----------- |
|   2. _spy_      | SPĪ         |
|   3. _malign_   | mƏ-LĪN′     |
|   4. _civilize_ | SIV′-Ə-līz′ |

\[_I_ or _i_ (without the top bar) is pronounced as in _it, sit, pitch.]_

(e) _All consonants have their normal sounds._

Except for _G_ (or _g_), which is _always pronounced as in give, girl, get, go._

|   1. _agree_ | Ə-GREE′  |
| ------------ | -------- |
|   2. _pagan_ | PAY′-gƏn |
|   3. _again_ | Ə-GEN′   |

(f) _The vowel sounds are as follows:_

| SYMBOL       | EXAMPLE                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1. A, a    | _cat_ (KAT)                                             |
|   2. E, e    | _wet_ (WET)                                             |
|   3. I, i    | _sit_ (SIT)                                             |
|   4. O, o    | _knot_ (NOT)                                            |
|   5. U, u    | _nut_ (NUT)                                             |
|   6. AH, ah  | _martinet_ (mahr′-tƏ-NET′)                              |
|   7. AW, aw  | _for_ (FAWR); _incorrigible_ (in-KAWR′-Ə-jƏ-bƏl)        |
|   8. AY, ay  | _ate_ (AYT); _magnate_ (MAG′-nayt)                      |
|   9. EE, ee  | _equal_ (EE′-kwƏl); _clandestinely_ (klan-DES′-tƏn-lee) |
| 10. Ō, ō     | _toe_ (TŌ); _concerto_ (kƏn-CHUR′-tō)                   |
| 11. ,        | _book_ (BK); _prurient_ (PRR′-ee-Ənt)                   |
| 12. ,        | _doom_ (DM); _blue_ (BL)                                |
| 13. OW, ow   | _about_ (Ə-BOWT′)                                       |
| 14. OY, oy   | _soil_ (SOYL)                                           |
| 15. ING, ing | _taking_ (TAYK′-ing)                                    |

(g) _TH_ or _th_ is pronounced as in _thing;_  or  is pronounced as in _this._

**3. a word (or words) on western and eastern pronunciation**

In the New York City area, and in parts of New Jersey and other eastern states, the syllables -_ar, -er, -or, -off_, and -_aw_ are pronounced somewhat differently from the way they are said in the Midwest and in the West.

In New York City, for example, the words below are generally pronounced as follows:

| orange       | AHR′-Ənj                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| talk         | TAWK                      |
| coffee       | KAW′-fee                  |
| sorority     | sƏ-RAHR′-Ə-tee            |
| incorrigible | in-KAHR′-Ə-jƏ-bƏl         |
| disparage    | dis-PAR′-Əj (A as in HAT) |
| merry        | MER′-ee (E as in WET)     |
| marry        | MAR′-ee (A as in HAT)     |
| astronaut    | AS′-trƏ-nawt′             |
| Harry        | HAR′-ee (A as in HAT)     |

In the Midwest and West, on the other hand, the same words are usually said approximately as follows:

| orange       | AWR′-Ənj          |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| talk         | TOK               |
| coffee       | KOF′-ee           |
| sorority     | sƏ-RAWR′-Ə-tee    |
| incorrigible | in-KAWR′-Ə-jƏ-bƏl |
| disparage    | dis-PAIR′-Əj      |
| merry        | MAIR′-ee          |
| marry        | MAIR′-ee          |
| astronaut    | AS′-trƏ-not′      |
| Harry        | HAIR′-ee          |

Nothing so radical here that a person brought up in Brooklyn or the Bronx cannot understand a native of Los Angeles or San Francisco—it’s just that each one thinks _the other_ has an accent!

In California, for example, _Mary, merry_, and _marry_ sound almostexactly alike—in New York, they are usually heard as quite different words.

(So, to be sexist for a moment, if the men at a party in Manhattan say, “Let’s all make merry!”, Mary doesn’t feel that she is about to be seduced by the males!)

In the phonetic respellings throughout the book, the western pronunciations of words with the syllables remarked on above are used. This is done largely because I myself have lived in the Los Angeles area for some fourteen years, and have had to retrain my pronunciation (having come from New York City, where I was born, and lived all my life until 1964) so that my friends and students would stop making fun of the way I speak.

_Neither form of pronunciation is any better nor any more euphonious than the other._ Throughout the country, pronunciation varies not only from region to region or state to state, but often from city to city! The changes are slight and subtle, but they do exist, and an expert can easily pinpoint the geographical source of a person’s language patterns almost down to a few square miles in area.

If you are an Easterner, you will have no difficulty translating the pronunciations of words like _sorority, incorrigible, disparage_, and _astronaut_ (all words discussed in later chapters) into your own comfortable language patterns.

**4. why etymology?**

_Etymology_ (et′-Ə-MOL′-Ə-jee) deals with the origin or derivation of words.

When you know the meaning of a root (for example, Latin _ego_, I or self), you can better understand, and more easily remember, _all_ the words built on this root.

_Learn one root and you have the key that will unlock the meanings of up to ten or twenty words in which the root appears._

Learn _ego_ and you can immediately get a handle on _egocentric, egomaniac, egoist, egotist_, and _alter ego._

Learn _anthropos_ (Greek, mankind), and you will quickly understand, and never forget, _anthropology, misanthropy, anthropoid_,_anthropocentric, anthropomorphic, philanthropy,_ and _anthropophobia._ Meet any word with _anthropo_- in it, and you will have at least some idea of its meaning.

In the _etymological_ (et′Ə-mƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl) approach to vocabulary building:

• You will learn about _prefixes, roots_, and _suffixes_—

• You will be able to figure out unfamiliar words by recognizing their structure, the building blocks from which they are constructed—

• You will be able to construct words correctly by learning to put these building blocks together in the proper way—and

• You will be able to derive verbs from nouns, nouns and verbs from adjectives, adjectives from nouns, etc.—and do all this correctly.

_Learn how to deal with etymology and you will feel comfortable with words—you will use new words with self-assurance—you will be able to figure out thousands of words you hear or read even if you have never heard or seen these words before._

That’s why the best approach to new words is through etymology<sup>3</sup>—as you will discover for yourself as soon as you start to work on chapter 3!

**5. but what are nouns, verbs, and adjectives?**

You probably know.

But if you don’t, you can master these parts of speech (and reference will be made to _noun forms, verb forms_, and _adjective forms_ throughout the book) within the next five minutes.

(a) A _noun_ is a word that can be preceded by _a, an, the, some, such_, or _my._

An _egoist_ (noun)

Such _asceticism_ (noun)

The _misogynist_ (noun)

(Nouns, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: -_ness, -ity, -ism, -y, -ion_, etc.)

(b) A _verb_ is a word that fits into the pattern, “Let us \_\_\_.” A verb has a past tense.

Let us _equivocate_ (verb)—past tense: _equivocated._

Let us _alternate_ (verb)—past tense: _alternated._

Let us _philander_ (verb)—past tense: _philandered._

(Verbs, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: -_ate, -ize, -fy_, etc.)

(c) An _adjective_ is a word that fits into the pattern, “You are very\_\_\_.”

You are very _egoistic_ (adjective).

You are very _introverted_ (adjective).

You are very _misogynous_ (adjective).

(Adjectives, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: -_ic, -ed, -ous, -al, -ive_, etc.)

And _adverbs_, of course, are generally formed by adding -_ly_ to an adjective: _misogynous-misogynously; educational-educationally;_ etc.

That’s all there is to it! (Did it take more than five minutes? Maybe ten at the most?)

**6. how to work for best results**

If you intend to work with this book seriously (that is, if your clear intention is to add a thousand or more new words to your present vocabulary—add them permanently, unforgettably—add them so successfully that you will soon find yourself using them in speech and writing), I suggest that you give yourself every advantage by carefully following the laws of learning:

(a) _Space your learning._

Beginning with Chapter 3, every chapter will be divided into “sessions.” Each session may take one half hour to an hour and a half, depending on the amount of material and on your own speed of learning.

Do one or two sessions at a time—three if you’re going strong and are all involved—and always decide when you stop _exactly when_ you will return. (I remind you to do this later in the book, since such a procedure is of crucial importance.)

(b) _Do not rush—go at your own comfortable speed._

Everyone learns at a different pace. Fast learners are no better than slow learners—it’s the end result that counts, not the time it takes you to finish.

(c) _Review._

When you start a new session, go back to the last exercise of the previous session (usually _Can you recall the words?_ or _Chapter Review_), cover your answers, and test your retention—do you have quick recall after a day or so has elapsed?

(d) _Test yourself._

You are not aiming for a grade, or putting your worth on the line, when you take the three Comprehensive Tests (Chapters 8, 13, and 17)—rather you are discovering your weaknesses, if any; deciding where repairs have to be made; and, especially, experiencing a feeling of success at work well done. (In learning, too, nothing succeeds like success!)

Use these three tests, as well as the abundant drill exercises, as aids to learning. No one is perfect, no one learns in the exact same way or at the same rate as anyone else. Find the optimum technique and speed for _your_ unique learning patterns—and then give yourself every opportunity to exploit your actual, latent, and potential abilities.

_But most important_ (_as I will remind you several times throughout the book_)—_develop a routine and stick to it!_

***

<sup>1</sup> The system of pronunciation symbols will be thoroughly explained in Section 2 of this chapter.

<sup>2</sup> All unusual words in this chapter are taught in later chapters of the book.

<sup>3</sup> Incidentally, Latin scholars will notice that I present a Latin verb in the first person singular, present tense (_verto_, I turn), but call it an infinitive (_verto_, to turn). I do this for two reasons: 1) _verto_ is easier for a non-Latin scholar to pronounce (the actual infinitive, _vertere_, is pronounced WAIR′-tƏ-ray); and 2) when I studied Latin fifty years ago, the convention was to refer to a verb by using the first person singular, present tense.

If you are not a Latin scholar, you need not bother to read this footnote—if you’ve already done so, forget it!
