## HOW TO AVOID BEING A PURIST

Life, as you no doubt realize, is complicated enough these days. Yet puristic textbooks and English teachers with puristic ideas are striving to make it still more complicated. Their contribution to the complexity of modern living is the repeated claim that many of the natural, carefree, and popular expressions that most of us use every day are “bad English,” “incorrect grammar,” “vulgar,” or “illiterate.”

In truth, many of the former restrictions and “thou shalt nots” of academic grammar are now outmoded—most educated speakers quite simply ignore them.

Students in my grammar classes at Rio Hondo College are somewhat nonplused when they discover that correctness is not determined by textbook rules and cannot be enforced by schoolteacher edict. They invariably ask: “Aren’t you going to draw the line somewhere?”

It is neither necessary nor possible for any one person to “draw the line.” That is done—and quite effectively—by the people themselves, by the millions of educated people throughout the nation.

Of course certain expressions may be considered “incorrect” or “illiterate” or “bad grammar”—not because they violate puristicrules, but only because they are rarely if ever used by educated speakers.

Correctness, in short, is determined by current educated usage.

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is “right” or “wrong,” then compare your conclusions with the opinions given after the test.

#### TEST YOURSELF

&#x20; 1\. Let’s not walk any _further_ right now.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 2\. Some people admit that their _principle_ goal in life is to become wealthy.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 3\. What a _nice_ thing to say!

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 4\. He’s _pretty_ sick today.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 5\. I feel _awfully_ sick.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 6\. Are you going to invite Doris and _I_ to your party?

RIGHT      WRONG

1\. Let’s not walk any _further_ right now.

RIGHT. In the nineteenth century, when professional grammarians attempted to Latinize English grammar, an artificial distinction was drawn between _farther_ and _further_, to wit: _farther_ refers to space, _further_ means _to a greater extent_ or _additional._ Today, as a result, many teachers who are still under the forbidding influence of nineteenth-century restrictions insist that it is incorrect to use one word for the other.

To check on current attitudes toward this distinction, I sent the test sentence above to a number of dictionary editors, authors, and professors of English, requesting their opinion of the acceptability of _further_ in reference to actual distance. Sixty out of eighty-seven professors, over two thirds of those responding, accepted theusage without qualification. Of twelve dictionary editors, eleven accepted _further_, and in the case of the authors, thirteen out of twenty-three accepted the word as used. A professor of English at Cornell University remarked: “I know of no justification for any present-day distinction between _further_ and _farther_”; and a consulting editor of the Funk and Wagnalls dictionary said, “There is nothing controversial here. As applied to spatial distance, _further_ and _farther_ have long been interchangeable.”

Perhaps the comment of a noted author and columnist is most to the point: “I like both _further_ and _farther_, as I have never been able to tell which is which or why one is any farther or further than the other.”

2\. Some people admit that their _principle_ goal in life is to become wealthy.

WRONG. In speech, you can get _principal_ and _principle_ confused as often as you like, and no one will ever know the difference—both words are pronounced identically. In writing, however, your spelling will give you away.

There is a simple memory trick that will help you if you get into trouble with these two words. _Rule_ and _principle_ both end in -_le_—and a princi&#x70;_&#x6C;e_ is a r&#x75;_&#x6C;e._ On the other hand, _principal_ contains an _a_, and so does _main_—and principal means main. Get these points straight and your confusion is over.

Heads of schools are called _principals_, because they are the _main_ person in that institution of learning. The money you have in the bank is your _principal_, your _main_ financial assets. And the stars of a play are _principals_—the _main_ actors.

Thus, “Some people admit that their _principal_ (main) goal in life is to become wealthy,” but “Such a _principle_ (rule) is not guaranteed to lead to happiness.”

3\. What a _nice_ thing to say!

RIGHT. Purists object to the popular use of _nice_ as a synonym for _pleasant, agreeable_, or _delightful._ They wish to restrict the word to its older and more erudite meaning of _exact_ or _subtle._ You will be happy to hear that they aren’t getting anywhere.

When I polled a group of well-known authors on the acceptability in everyday speech of the popular meaning of _nice_, theiropinions were unanimous; not a single dissenting voice, out of the twenty-three authors who answered, was raised against the usage. One writer responded: “It has been right for about 150 years …”

Editors of magazines and newspapers questioned on the same point were just a shade more conservative. Sixty out of sixty-nine accepted the usage. One editor commented: “I think we do not have to be nice about _nice_ any longer. No one can eradicate it from popular speech as a synonym for _pleasant_, or _enjoyable_, or _kind_, or _courteous._ It is a workhorse of the vocabulary, and properly so.”

The only valid objection to the word is that it is _overworked_ by some people, but this shows a weakness in vocabulary rather than in grammar.

As in the famous story of the editor who said to her secretary: “There are two words I wish you would stop using so much. One is ‘nice’ and the other is ‘lousy.’ ”

“Okay,” said the secretary, who was eager to please. “What are they?”

4\. He’s _pretty_ sick today.

RIGHT. One of the purist’s pet targets of attack is the word _pretty_ as used in the sentence under discussion. Yet all modern dictionaries accept such use of _pretty_, and a survey made by a professor at the University of Wisconsin showed that the usage is established English.

5\. I feel _awfully_ sick.

RIGHT. Dictionaries accept this usage in informal speech and the University of Wisconsin survey showed that it is established English.

The great popularity of _awfully_ in educated speech is no doubt due to the strong and unique emphasis that the word gives to an adjective—substitute _very, quite, extremely_, or _severely_ and you considerably weaken the force.

On the other hand, it is somewhat less than cultivated to say “I feel _awful_ sick,” and the wisdom of using _awfully_ to intensify a _pleasant_ concept (“What an _awfully_ pretty child”; “That book is _awfully_ interesting”) is perhaps still debatable, though getting less and less so as the years go on.

6\. Are you going to invite Doris and _I_ to your party?

WRONG. Some people are almost irresistibly drawn to the pronoun _I_ in constructions like this one. However, not only does such use of _I_ violate a valid and useful grammatical principle, but, more important, it is rarely heard in educated speech. The meaning of the sentence is equally clear no matter which form of the pronoun is employed, of course, but the use of _I_, the less popular choice, may stigmatize the speaker as uneducated.

Consider it this way: You would normally say, “Are you going to invite _me_ to your party?” It would be wiser, therefore, to say, “Are you going to invite Doris and _me_ to your party?”
