## RANDOM NOTES ON MODERN USAGE

English grammar is confusing enough as it is—what makes it doubly confounding is that it is slowly but continually changing.

This means that some of the strict rules you memorized so painfully in your high school or college English courses may no longer be completely valid.

Following such outmoded principles, you may think you are speaking “perfect” English, and instead you may sound stuffy and pedantic.

The problem boils down to this: If grammatical usage is gradually becoming more liberal, where does educated, unaffected, informal speech end? And where does illiterate, ungrammatical speech begin?

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thought in just terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinion given in the explanatory paragraphs that follow the test.

RIGHT      WRONG

14\. Peggy and Karen are _alumni_ of the same high school.

RIGHT      WRONG

15\. I _would_ like to ask you a question.

RIGHT      WRONG

&#x20; 1\. If you drink too many vodka martinis, you will surely _get_ sick.

RIGHT. The puristic objection is that _get_ has only one meaning—namely, _obtain._ However, as any modern dictionary will attest, _get_ has scores of different meanings, one of the most respectable of which is _become._ You can _get_ tired, _get_ dizzy, _get_ drunk, or _get_ sick—and your choice of words will offend no one but a pedant.

2\. Have you _got_ a dollar?

RIGHT. If purists get a little pale at the sound of “_get_ sick,” they turn chalk white when they hear _have got_ as a substitute for _have._ But the fact is that _have got_ is an established American form of expression. Jacques Barzun, noted author and literary critic, says: “_Have you got_ is good idiomatic English—I use it in speech without thinking about it and would write it if colloquialism seemed appropriate to the passage.”

&#x20; 3\. No ones loves you except _I._

WRONG. In educated speech, _me_ follows the preposition _except._ This problem is troublesome because, to the unsophisticated, the sentence sounds as if it can be completed to “No one loves you, except _I_ do,” but current educated usage adheres to the technical rule that a preposition requires an objective pronoun (_me_).

&#x20; 4\. Please _lay_ down.

WRONG. Liberal as grammar has become, there is still no sanction for using _lay_ with the meaning of _recline. Lay_ means to place, as in “_Lay_ your hand on mine.” _Lie_ is the correct choice.

&#x20; 5\. _Who_ do you love?

RIGHT. “The English language shows some disposition to get rid of _whom_ altogether, and unquestionably it would be a better language with _whom_ gone.” So wrote Janet Rankin Aiken, of Columbia University, way back in 1936. Today, many decades later, the “disposition” has become a full-fledged force.

The rules for _who_ and _whom_ are complicated, and few educated speakers have the time, patience, or expertise to bother with them. Use the democratic _who_ in your everyday speech whenever it sounds right.

&#x20; 6\. Neither of these cars _are_ worth the money.

WRONG. The temptation to use _are_ in this sentence is, I admit, practically irresistible. However, “neither of” means “neither _one_ of” and _is_, therefore, is the preferable verb.

&#x20; 7\. The judge sentenced the murderer to be _hung._

WRONG. A distinction is made, in educated speech, between _hung_ and _hanged._ A picture is _hung_, but a person is _hanged_—that is, if such action is intended to bring about an untimely demise.

&#x20; 8\. Mother, _can_ I go out to play?

RIGHT. If you insist that your child say _may_, and nothing but _may_, when asking for permission, you may be considered puristic. _Can_ is not discourteous, incorrect, or vulgar—and the newest editions of the authoritative dictionaries fully sanction the use of _can_ in requesting rights, privileges, or permission.

&#x20; 9\. Take two _spoonsful_ of this medicine every three hours.

WRONG. There is a strange affection, on the part of some people, for _spoonsful_ and _cupsful_, even though _spoonsful_ and _cupsful_ do not exist as acceptable words. The plurals are _spoonfuls_ and _cupfuls._

I am taking for granted, of course, that you are using one spoon and filling it twice. If, for secret reasons of your own, you prefer to take your medicine in two separate spoons, you may then properly speak of “two _spoons full_ (not _spoonsful_) of medicine.”

10\. Your words seem to _infer_ that Jack is a liar.

WRONG. _Infer_ does not mean _hint_ or _suggest. Imply_ is the proper word; to _infer_ is to draw a conclusion from another’s words.

11\. I _will_ be happy to go to the concert with you.

RIGHT. In informal speech, you need no longer worry about the technical and unrealistic distinctions between _shall_ and _will._ The theory of modern grammarians is that _shall-will_ differences were simply invented out of whole cloth by the textbook writers of the 1800s. As the editor of the scholarly _Modern Language Forum_ at the University of California has stated, “The artificial distinction between _shall_ and _will_ to designate futurity is a superstition that has neither a basis in historical grammar nor the sound sanction of universal usage.”

12\. It is _me._

RIGHT. This “violation” of grammatical “law” has been completely sanctioned by current usage. When the late Winston Churchill made a nationwide radio address from New Haven, Connecticut, many, many years ago, his opening sentence was: “This is _me_, Winston Churchill.” I imagine that the purists who were listening fell into a deep state of shock at these words, but of course Churchill was simply using the kind of down-to-earth English that had long since become standard in informal educated speech.

13\. Go _slow._

RIGHT. “Go _slow_” is not, and never has been, incorrect English—every authority concedes that _slow_ is an adverb as well as an adjective. Rex Stout, well-known writer of mystery novels and creator of Detective Nero Wolfe, remarked: “Not only do I use and approve of the idiom _Go slow_, but if I find myself with people who do not, I leave quick.”

14\. Peggy and Karen are _alumni_ of the same high school.

WRONG. As Peggy and Karen are obviously women, we call them _alumnae_ (Ə-LUM′-nee); only male graduates are _alumni_ (Ə-LUM′-nī).

15\. I _would_ like to ask you a question.

RIGHT. In current American usage, _would_ may be used with _I_, though old-fashioned rules demand _I should._

Indeed, in modern speech, _should_ is almost entirely restricted to expressing probability, duty, or responsibility.

As in the case of the charitable-looking dowager who was approached by a seedy character seeking a handout.

“Madam,” he whined, “I haven’t eaten in five days.”

“My good man,” the matron answered with great concern, “you should force yourself!”
