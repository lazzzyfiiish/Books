## SOME INTERESTING DERIVATIONS

#### PEOPLE WHO MADE OUR LANGUAGE

**Bloomers**

Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller invented them in 1849, and showed a working model to a famous women’s rights advocate, _Amelia J. Bloomer._ Amelia was fascinated by the idea of garments that were both modest (they then reached right down to the ankles) and convenient—and promptly sponsored them.…

**Boycott**

_Charles C. Boycott_ was an English land agent whose difficult duty it was to collect high rents from Irish farmers. In protest, the farmers ostracized him, not even allowing him to make purchases in town or hire workers to harvest his crops.

**Marcel**

_Marcel_ was an ingenious Parisian hairdresser who felt he could improve on the button curls popular in 1875. He did, and made a fortune.

**Silhouette**

Finance Minister of France just before the Revolution, _Etienne de Silhouette_ advocated the _simple_ life, so that excess money could go into the treasury instead of into luxurious living. And the profile is the _simplest_ form of portraiture, if you get the connection.

**Derrick**

A seventeenth-century English hangman, _Derrick_ by name, hoisted to their death some of the most notorious criminals of the day.

**Sadist**

Because _Count de Sade_, an eighteenth-century Frenchman, found his greatest delight in torturing friends and mistresses, the term _sadist_ was derived from his name. His works shocked his nation and the world by the alarming frankness with which he described his morbid and bloodthirsty cruelty.

**Galvanism**

_Luigi Galvani_, the Italian physiologist, found by accident that an electrically charged scalpel could send a frog’s corpse into muscular convulsions. Experimenting further, he eventually discovered the principles of chemically produced electricity. His name is responsible not only for the technical expressions _galvanism, galvanized iron_, and _galvanometer_, but also for that highly graphic phrase, “_galvanized_ into action.”

**Guppies**

In 1868, _R. J. Lechmere Guppy_, president of the Scientific Association of Trinidad, sent some specimens of a tiny tropical fish to the British Museum. Ever since, fish of this species have been called _guppies._

**Nicotine**

Four hundred years ago, _Jean Nicot_, a French ambassador, bought some tobacco seeds from a Flemish trader. Nicot’s successful efforts to popularize the plant in Europe brought him linguistic immortality.

#### PLACES THAT MADE OUR LANGUAGE

**Bayonne, France**

Where first was manufactured the daggerlike weapon that fits over the muzzle end of a rifle—the _bayonet._

**Cantalupo, Italy**

The first place in Europe to grow those luscious melons we now call _cantaloupes._

**Calicut, India**

The city from which we first imported a kind of cotton cloth now known as _calico._

**Tuxedo Park, New York**

In the country club of this exclusive and wealthy community, the short (no tails) dinner coat for men, or _tuxedo_, was popularized.

**Egypt**

It was once supposed that the colorful, fortunetelling wanderers, or _Gypsies_, hailed from this ancient land.

**Damascus, Syria**

Where an elaborately patterned silk, _damask_, was first made.

**Tzu-t’ing, China**

Once a great seaport in Fukien Province. Marco Polo called it _Zaitun_, and in time a silk fabric made there was called _satin._

**Frankfurt, Germany**

Where the burghers once greatly enjoyed their smoked beef and pork sausages, which we now ask for in delicatessen stores and supermarkets by the name of _frankfurters, franks_, or _hot dogs._
