### SESSION 4 <a href="#page55" id="page55"></a>

In this chapter we discuss ten medical specialists—what they do, how they do it, what they are called.

#### IDEAS

**1. what’s wrong with you?**

To find out what ails you and why, this specialist gives you a thorough physical examination, using an impressive array of tests: X ray, blood chemistry, urinalysis, cardiogram, and so on.

An _internist_

**2. female troubles?**

This specialist treats the female reproductive and sexual organs.

A _gynecologist_

**3. having a baby?**

This specialist delivers babies and takes care of the mother during and immediately after the period of her pregnancy.

An _obstetrician_

**4. is your baby ill?**

You know the common childhood maladies—mumps, whooping cough, chicken pox, measles. This specialist limits his practice to youngsters, taking care of babies directly after birth, supervising their diet and watching over their growth and development, giving them the series of inoculations that has done so much to decrease infant mortality, and soothing their anxious parents.

A _pediatrician_

**5. skin clear?**

You have heard the classic riddle: “What is the best use for pigskin?” Answer: “To keep the pig together.” Human skin has a similar purpose: it is, if we get down to fundamentals, what keeps us all in one piece. And our outer covering, like so many of our internal organs, is subject to diseases and infections of various kinds, running the gamut from simple acne and eczemas through impetigo, psoriasis, and cancer. There is a specialist who treats all such skin diseases.

A _dermatologist_

**6. eyes okay?**

The physician whose specialty is disorders of vision (myopia, astigmatism, cataracts, glaucoma, etc.) may prescribe glasses, administer drugs, or perform surgery.

An _ophthalmologist_

**7. how are your bones?**

This specialist deals with the skeletal structure of the body, treating bone fractures, slipped discs, clubfoot, curvature of the spine, dislocations of the hip, etc., and may correct a condition either by surgery or by the use of braces or other appliances.

An _orthopedist_

**8. does your heart go pitter-patter?**

This specialist treats diseases of the heart and circulatory system.

A _cardiologist_

**9. is your brain working?**

This physician specializes in the treatment of disorders of the brain, spinal cord, and the rest of the nervous system.

A _neurologist_

**10. are you neurotic?**

This specialist attempts to alleviate mental and emotional disturbances by means of various techniques, occasionally drugs or electroshock, more often private or group psychotherapy.

A _psychiatrist_

#### USING THE WORDS

**Can you pronounce the words?**

Words take on a new color if you hear them in your own voice; they begin to belong to you more personally, more intimately, than if you merely hear or read them. As always, therefore, _say the words aloud_ to take the first, crucial step toward complete mastery.

(_End of session 4_)

### SESSION 5

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. inside you**

_Internist_ and _internal_ derive from the same Latin root, _internus_, inside. The _internist_ is a specialist in _internal_ medicine, in the explorationof your _insides._ This physician determines the state of your internal organs in order to discover what’s happening _within_ your body to cause the troubles you’re complaining of.

Do not confuse the _internist_ with the _intern_ (also spelled _interne_), who is a medical graduate serving an apprenticeship _inside_ a hospital.

**2. doctors for women**

The word _gynecologist_ is built on Greek _gyne_, woman, plus _logos_, science; etymologically, _gynecology_ is the science (in actual use, the medical science) of women. Adjective: _gynecological_ (gīn \[_or_ jin _or_ jīn]-Ə-kƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

_Obstetrician_ derives from Latin _obstetrix_, midwife, which in turn has its source in a Latin verb meaning _to stand_—midwives stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the infant.

The suffix -_ician_, as in _obstetrician, physician, musician, magician, electrician_, etc., means _expert._

_Obstetrics_ (ob-STET′-riks) has only within the last 150 years become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Professor William P. Dewees assumed the first chair of _obstetrics_ at the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave considerable medical contempt and ridicule as a result—the delivery of children was then considered beneath the dignity of the medical profession.

Adjective: _obstetric_ (ob-STET′-rik) or _obstetrical_ (ob-STET′-rƏ-kƏl).

**3. children**

_Pediatrician_ is a combination of Greek _paidos_, child; _iatreia_, medical healing; and -_ician_, expert.

_Pediatrics_ (pee-dee-AT′-riks), then, is by etymology the medical healing of a child. Adjective: _pediatric_ (pee-dee-AT′-rik).

(The _ped_- you see in words like _pedestal, pedal_, and _pedestrian_ is from the Latin _pedis_, foot, and despite the identical spelling in English has no relationship to Greek _paidos._)

_Pedagogy_ (PED-Ə-gō′-jee), which combines _paidos_ with _agogos_, leading, is, etymologically, _the leading of children._ And to what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, to maturity. From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults—they are taught, first by parents and then by teachers, to be self-sufficient, to fit into the culture in which they are born. Hence, _pedagogy_, which by derivation means _the leading of a child_, refers actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College students majoring in education take certain standard _pedagogy_ courses—the history of education; educational psychology; the psychology of adolescents; principles of teaching; etc. Adjective: _pedagogical_ (ped-Ə-GOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

A _pedagogue_ (PED′-Ə-gog) is versed in _pedagogy._ But _pedagogue_ has an unhappy history. From its original, neutral meaning of _teacher_, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers, today, to a narrow-minded, strait-laced, old-fashioned, dogmatic teacher. It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution.

Like _pedagogue, demagogue_ (DEM′-Ə-gog) has also deteriorated in meaning. By derivation a leader (_agogos_) of the people (_demos_), a _demagogue_ today is actually one who attempts, in essence, to _mislead_ the people, a politician who foments discontent among the masses, rousing them to fever pitch by wild oratory, in an attempt to be voted into office.

Once elected, _demagogues_ use political power to further their own personal ambitions or fortunes.

Many “leaders” of the past and present, in countries around the world, have been accused of _demagoguery_ (dem-Ə-GOG′-Ə-ree). Adjective: _demagogic_ (dem-Ə-GOJ′-ik).

**4. skin-deep**

The _dermatologist_, whose specialty is _dermatology_ (dur-mƏ-TOL′-Ə-jee), is so named from Greek _derma_, skin. Adjective: _dermatological_ (dur′-mƏ-tƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

See the syllables _derma_ in any English word and you will know there is some reference to _skin_—for example, a _hypodermic_ (hī-pƏ-DUR′-mik) needle penetrates _under_ (Greek, _hypos_) the _skin;_ the _epidermis_ (ep-Ə-DUR′-mis) is the outermost layer of _skin;_ a _taxidermist_ (TAKS′-Ə-dur-mist), whose business is _taxidermy_(TAKS′-Ə-dur-mee), prepares, stuffs, and mounts the _skins_ of animals; a _pachyderm_ (PAK′-Ə-durm) is an animal with an unusually thick _skin_, like an elephant, hippopotamus, or rhinoceros; and _dermatitis_ (dur-mƏ-TĪ′-tis) is the general name for any _skin_ inflammation, irritation, or infection.

**5. the eyes have it**

_Ophthalmologist_—note the _ph_ preceding _th_—is from Greek _ophthalmos_, eye, plus _logos_, science or study. The specialty is _ophthalmology_ (off′-thal-MOL′-Ə-jee), the adjective _ophthalmological_ (off′-thal-mƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is _oculist_ (OK′-yƏ-list), from Latin _oculus_, eye, a root on which the following English words are also built:

1\. _ocular_ (OK′-yƏ-lƏr)—an adjective that refers to the eye

2\. _monocle_ (MON′-Ə-kƏl)—a lens for one (_monos_) eye, sported by characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called upper class

3\. _binoculars_ (bƏ-NOK′-yƏ-lƏrz)—field glasses that increase the range of two (_bi_-) eyes

4\. And, strangely enough, _inoculate_ (in-OK′-yƏ-layt′), a word commonly misspelled with two _n’s._ When you are _inoculated_ against a disease, an “eye,” puncture, or hole is made in your skin, through which serum is injected.

Do not confuse the _ophthalmologist_ or _oculist_, a medical specialist, with two other practitioners who deal with the eye—the _optometrist_ (op-TOM′-Ə-trist) and _optician_ (op-TISH′-Ən).

_Optometrists_ are not physicians, and do not perform surgery or administer drugs; they measure vision, test for glaucoma, and prescribe and fit glasses.

_Opticians_ fill an _optometrist’s_ or _ophthalmologist’s_ prescription, grinding lenses according to specifications; they do not examine patients.

_Optometrist_ combines Greek _opsis, optikos_, sight or vision, with _metron_, measurement—the _optometrist_, by etymology, is one who measures vision. The specialty is _optometry_ (op-TOM′-Ə-tree).

_Optician_ is built on _opsis, optikos_, plus -_ician_, expert. The specialty is _optics_ (OP′-tiks).

Adjectives: _optometric_ (op-tƏ-MET′-rik) or _optometrical_ (op-tƏ-MET′-rƏ-kƏl), _optical_ (OP′-tƏ-kƏl).

### SESSION 6

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. the straighteners**

The _orthopedist_ is so called from the Greek roots _orthos_, straight or correct, and _paidos_, child. The _orthopedist_, by etymology, straightens children. The term was coined in 1741 by the author of a textbook on the prevention of childhood diseases—at that time the correction of spinal curvature in children was a main concern of practitioners of _orthopedics_ (awr-thƏ-PEE′-diks).

Today the specialty treats deformities, injuries, and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), often by surgical procedures.

Adjective: _orthopedic_ (awr-thƏ-PEE′-dik).

_Orthodontia_ (awr-thƏ-DON′-shƏ), the straightening of teeth, is built on _orthos_ plus _odontos_, tooth. The _orthodontist_ (awr-thƏ-DON′-tist) specializes in improving your “bite,” retracting “buck teeth,” and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it that every molar, incisor, bicuspid, etc. is exactly where it belongs in your mouth.

Adjective: _orthodontic_ (awr-thƏ-DON′-tik).

**2. the heart**

_Cardiologist_ combines Greek _kardia_, heart, and _logos_, science.

The specialty is _cardiology_ (kahr-dee-OL′-Ə-jee), the adjective _cardiological_ (kahr′-dee-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

So a _cardiac_ (KAHR′-dee-ak) condition refers to some malfunctioning of the heart; a _cardiogram_ (KAHR′-dee-Ə-gram′) is an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument that produces this record is called a _cardiograph_ (KAHR′-dee-Ə-graf′).

**3. the nervous system**

_Neurologist_ derives from Greek _neuron_, nerve, plus _logos_, science.

Specialty: _neurology_ (nr-OL′-Ə-jee); adjective: _neurological_ (nr-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

_Neuralgia_ (nr-AL′-ja) is acute pain along the nerves and their branches; the word comes from _neuron_ plus _algos_, pain.

_Neuritis_ (nr-Ī-tis), is inflammation of the nerves.

_Neurosis_ (nr-Ō′-sis), combining _neuron_ with -_osis_, a suffix meaning _abnormal or diseased condition_, is not, despite its etymology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as described by the late Eric Berne, a psychiatrist, “…  an illness characterized by excessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that personality development is hindered or stopped. A man who spends mostof his time worrying about his health, counting his money, plotting revenge, or washing his hands, can hope for little emotional growth.”

_Neurotic_ (nr-OT′-ik) is both the adjective form and the term for a person suffering from _neurosis._

**4. the mind**

A _neurosis_ is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blown mental disorder is called a _psychosis_ (sī-KŌ′-sis), a word built on Greek _psyche_, spirit, soul, or mind, plus -_osis._

A true _psychotic_ (sī-KOT′-ik) has lost contact with reality—at least with reality as most of us perceive it, though no doubt _psychotic_ (note that this word, like _neurotic_, is both a noun and an adjective) people have their own form of reality.

Built on _psyche_ plus _iatreia_, medical healing, a _psychiatrist_ by etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is _psychiatry_ (sī- _or_ sƏ-KĪ-Ə-tree); the adjective is _psychiatric_ (sī-kee-AT′-rik).

_Pediatrics_, as you know, is also built on _iatreia_, as is _podiatry_ (pƏ-DĪ′-Ə-tree), discussed in the next chapter, and _geriatrics_ (jair′-ee-AT′-riks), the specialty dealing with the particular medical needs of the elderly. (This word combines _iatreia_ with Greek _geras_, old age.)

The specialist is a _geriatrician_ (jair′-ee-Ə-TRISH′-Ən), the adjective is _geriatric_ (jair′-ee-AT′-rik).

#### TWO KEYS TO SUCCESS: SELF-DISCIPLINE AND PERSISTENCE

_You can achieve a superior vocabulary in a phenomenally short time—given self-discipline and persistence._

The greatest aid in building self-discipline is, as I have said, a matter of devising a practical and comfortable schedule for yourself and then _keeping to that schedule._

Make sure to complete _at least_ one session each time you pick up the book, and always decide exactly when you will continue with your work before you put the book down.

There may be periods of difficulty—then is the time to exert the greatest self-discipline, the most determined persistence.

_For every page that you study will help you attain a mastery over words; every day that you work will add to your skill in understanding and using words._
