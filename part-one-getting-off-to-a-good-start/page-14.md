### SESSION 11 <a href="#page116" id="page116"></a>

A true scientist lives up to the etymological meaning of his title “one who knows.” Anything scientific is based on facts—observable facts that can be recorded, tested, checked, and verified.

Science, then, deals with human knowledge—as far as it has gone. It has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, when we stopped basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories that had no foundation in reality, and concepts of how the world _ought_ to be; and instead began to explore the world as it _was_, and not only the world but the whole universe. From Galileo, who looked through the first telescope atop a tower in Pisa, Italy, through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a microscope, to Einstein, who deciphered riddles of the universe by means of mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of ignorance.

Who are some of the more important explorers of knowledge—and by what terms are they known?

#### IDEAS

**1. whither mankind?**

The field is all mankind—how we developed in mind and body from primitive cultures and early forms.

An _anthropologist_

**2. what’s above?**

The field is the heavens and all that’s in them—planets, galaxies, stars, and other universes.

An _astronomer_

**3. and what’s below?**

The field is the comparatively little and insignificant whirling ball on which we live—the earth. How did our planet come into being, what is it made of, how were its mountains, oceans, rivers, plains, and valleys formed, and what’s down deep if you start digging?

A _geologist_

**4. what is life?**

The field is all living organisms—from the simplest one-celled amoeba to the amazingly complex and mystifying structure we call a human being. Plant or animal, flesh or vegetable, denizen of water, earth, or air—if it lives and grows, this scientist wants to know more about it.

A _biologist_

**5. flora**

Biology classifies life into two great divisions—plant and animal. This scientist’s province is the former category—flowers, trees, shrubs, mosses, marine vegetation, blossoms, fruits, seeds, grasses, and all the rest that make up the plant kingdom.

A _botanist_

**6. and fauna**

Animals of every description, kind, and condition, from birds to bees, fish to fowl, reptiles to humans, are the special area of exploration of this scientist.

A _zoologist_

**7. and all the little bugs**

There are over 650,000 different species of insects, and millions of individuals of every species—and this scientist is interested in every one of them.

An _entomologist_

**8. tower of Babel**

This linguistic scientist explores the subtle, intangible, elusive uses of that unique tool that distinguishes human beings from all other forms of life—to wit: language. This person is, in short, a student of linguistics, ancient and modern, primitive and cultured, Chinese, Hebrew, Icelandic, Slavic, Teutonic, and every other kind spoken now or in the past by human beings, not excluding that delightful hodgepodge known as “pidgin English,” in which a piano is described as “big box, you hit ’um in teeth, he cry,” and in which Hamlet’s famous quandary, “To be or not to be, that is the question…,” is translated into “Can do, no can do—how fashion?”

A _philologist_

**9. what do you really mean?**

This linguistic scientist explored the subtle, intangible, elusive relationship between language and thinking, between meaning and words; and is interested in determining the psychological causes and effects of what people say and write.

A _semanticist_

**10. who are your friends and neighbors?**

This scientist is a student of the ways in which people live together, their family and community structures and customs, their housing, their social relationships, their forms of government, and their layers of caste and class.

A _sociologist_

### SESSION 12

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. people and the stars**

_Anthropologist_ is constructed from roots we are familiar with—_anthropos_, mankind, and _logos_, science, study.

The science is _anthropology_ (an′-thrƏ-POL′-Ə-jee). Can you write the adjective form of this word? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (Can you pronounce it?)

_Astronomer_ is built on Greek _astron_, star, and _nomos_, arrangement, law, or order. The _astronomer_ is interested in the arrangementof stars and other celestial bodies. The science is _astronomy_ (Ə-STRON′-Ə-mee), the adjective is _astronomical_ (as′-trƏ-NOM′-Ə-kƏl), a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in “the _astronomical_ size of the national debt.” _Astronomy_ deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example, is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth at 186,000 miles per _second_) that the adjective _astronomical_ is applied to any tremendously large figure.

_Astron_, star, combines with _logos_ to form _astrology_ (Ə-STROL′-Ə-jee), which assesses the influence of planets and stars on human events. The practitioner is an _astrologer_ (Ə-STROL′-Ə-jƏr). Can you form the adjective?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (Can you pronounce it?)

By etymology, an _astronaut_ (AS′-trƏ-not′) is a sailor among the stars (Greek _nautes_, sailor). This person is termed with somewhat less exaggeration a _cosmonaut_ (KOZ′-mƏ-not′) by the Russians (Greek, _kosmos_, universe). _Nautical_ (NOT′-Ə-kƏl), relating to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from _nautes_, and _nautes_ in turn is from Greek _naus_, ship—a root used in _nausea_ (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!).

_Aster_ (AS′-tƏr) is a star shaped flower. _Asterisk_ (AS′-tƏ-risk), a star-shaped symbol (\*), is generally used in writing or printing to direct the reader to look for a footnote. _Astrophysics_ (as′-trƏ-FIZ′-iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly bodies.

_Disaster_ (dƏ-ZAS′-tƏr) and _disastrous_ (dƏ-ZAS′-trƏs) also come from _astron_, star. In ancient times it was believed that the stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or calamity, therefore, happened to someone because the stars were in opposition. (_Dis_-, a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies _against._)

_Nomos_, arrangement, law, or order, is found in two other interesting English words.

For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if you needn’t answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if you are independent, then you enjoy _autonomy_ (aw-TON′-Ə-mee), a word that combines _nomos_, law, with _autos_, self. _Autonomy_, then, is self-law, self-government. The fifty states in our nation are fairly _autonomous_ (aw-TON′-Ə-mƏs), but not completely so. On the other hand, in most colleges each separate department is pretty much _autonomous._ And of course, one of thebig reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that America wanted _autonomy_, rather than control by England.

You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to guide their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing) of the player. Hence it is called a _metronome_ (MET′-rƏ-nōm′), a word that combines _nomos_ with _metron_, measurement.

**2. the earth and its life**

_Geologist_ derives from Greek _ge_ (_geo_-), earth. The science is _geology_ (jee-OL′-Ə-jee). Can you write the adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (Can you pronounce it?)

_Geometry_ (jee-OM′-Ə-tree)—_ge_ plus _metron_—by etymology “measurement of the earth,” is that branch of mathematics treating of the measurement and properties of solid and plane figures, such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, prisms, etc. (The etymology of the word shows that this ancient science was originally concerned with the measurement of land and spaces on the earth.)

The mathematician is a _geometrician_ (jee′-Ə-mƏ-TRISH′-Ən), the adjective is _geometric_ (jee′-Ə-MET′-rik).

_Geography_ (jee-OG′-rƏ-fee) is writing about (_graphein_, to write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a _geographer_ (jee-OG′-rƏ-fƏr), the adjective is _geographic_ (jee-Ə-GRAF′-ik).

(The name _George_ is also derived from _ge_ (_geo_-), earth, plus _ergon_, work—the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.)

_Biologist_ combines _bios_, life, with _logos_, science, study. The science is _biology_ (bī-OL′-Ə-jee). The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

_Bios_, life, is also found in _biography_ (bī-OG′-rƏ-fee), writing about someone’s _life; autobiography_ (aw′-tƏ-bī-OG′-rƏ-fee), the story of one’s _life_ written by _oneself;_ and _biopsy_ (BĪ′-op-see), a medical examination, or view (_opsis, optikos_, view, vision), generally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investigatedfor evidence of malignancy. A _biopsy_ is contrasted with an _autopsy_ (AW′-top-see), which is a medical examination of a corpse in order to discover the cause of death. The _autos_ in _autopsy_ means, as you know, _self_—in an _autopsy_, etymologically speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or sight rather than by theorizing (i.e., “by viewing or seeing for oneself”), what brought the corpse to its present grievous state.

_Botanist_ is from Greek _botane_, plant. The field is _botany_ (BOT′-Ə-nee); the adjective is _botanical_ (bƏ-TAN′-Ə-kƏl).

_Zoologist_ is from Greek _zoion_, animal. The science is _zoology._ The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The combination of the two _o_’s tempts many people to pronounce the first three letters of these words in one syllable, thus: _zoo._ However, the two _o_’s should be separated, as in _co-operate_, even though no hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate such separation. Say zō-OL′-Ə-jist, zō-OL′-Ə-jee, zō′-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl. _Zoo_, a park for animals, is a shortened form of _zoological gardens_, and is, of course, pronounced in one syllable.

The _zodiac_ (ZŌ′-dee-ak) is a diagram, used in astrology, of the paths of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin names for various animals—_scorpio_, scorpion; _leo_, lion; _cancer_, crab; _taurus_, bull; _aries_, ram; and _pisces_, fish. Hence its derivation from _zoion_, animal.

The adjective is _zodiacal_ (zō-DĪ′-Ə-kƏl).

(_End of Session 12_)

### SESSION 13

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. cutting in and out**

Flies, bees, beetles, wasps, and other insects are segmented creatures—head, thorax, and abdomen. Where these parts join, there appears to the imaginative eye a “cutting in” of the body.

Hence the branch of zoology dealing with insects is aptly named _entomology_, from Greek _en_-, in, plus _tome_, a cutting. The adjective is _entomological_ (en′-tƏ-mƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

(The word _insect_ makes the same point—it is built on Latin _in_- in, plus _sectus_, a form of the verb meaning _to cut._)

The prefix _ec_-, from Greek _ek_-, means _out._ (The Latin prefix, you will recall, is _ex_-.) Combine _ec_- with _tome_ to derive the words for surgical procedures in which parts are “cut out,” or removed: _tonsillectomy_ (the tonsils), _appendectomy_ (the appendix), _mastectomy_ (the breast), _hysterectomy_ (the uterus), _prostatectomy_ (the prostate), etc.

Combine _ec_- with Greek _kentron_, center (the Latin root, as we have discovered, is _centrum_), to derive _eccentric_ (Ək-SEN′-trik)—_out of the center_, hence deviating from the normal in behavior, attitudes, etc., or unconventional, odd, strange. The noun is _eccentricity_ (ek′-sƏn-TRIS′-Ə-tee).

**2. more cuts**

The Greek prefix _a_- makes a root negative; the _atom_ (AT′-Əm) was so named at a time when it was considered the smallest possible particle of an element, that is, one that could _not_ be cut any further. (We have long since split the atom, of course, with results, as in most technological advances, both good and evil.) The adjective is _atomic_ (Ə-TOM′-ik).

The Greek prefix _ana_- has a number of meanings, one of which is _up_, as in _anatomy_ (Ə-NAT′-Ə-mee), originally the _cutting up_ of a plant or animal to determine its structure, later the bodily structure itself. The adjective is _anatomical_ (an′-Ə-TOM′-Ə-kƏl).

Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many volumes was called a _tome_ (TŌM)—etymologically, a part _cut_ from the whole. Today, a _tome_ designates, often disparagingly, an exceptionally large book, or one that is heavy and dull in content.

The Greek prefix _dicha_-, in two, combines with _tome_ to construct _dichotomy_ (dī-KOT′-Ə-mee), a splitting in two, a technical word used in astronomy, biology, botany, and the science of logic. It is also employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to the _dichotomy_ in the life of a man who is a government clerk all day and a night-school teacher after working hours, so that his life is, in a sense, split into two parts. The verb is _dichotomize_ (dī-KOT′-Ə-mīz′); the adjective is _dichotomous_ (dī-KOT′-Ə-mƏs). _Dichotomous_ thinking is the sort that divides everything into two parts—good and bad; white and black; Democrats and Republicans; etc. An unknown wit has made this classic statement about _dichotomous_ thinking: “There are two kinds of people: those who divide everything into two parts, and those who do not.”

Imagine a book, a complicated or massive report, or some other elaborate document—now figuratively cut on or through it so that you can get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in it. What you have is an _epitome_ (Ə-PIT′-Ə-mee), a condensation of the whole. (From _epi_-, on, upon, plus _tome._)

An _epitome_ may refer to a summary, condensation, or abridgment of language, as in “Let me have an _epitome_ of the book,” or “Give me the _epitome_ of his speech.”

More commonly, _epitome_ and the verb _epitomize_ (Ə-PIT′-Ə-mīz′) are used in sentences like “She is the _epitome_ of kindness,” or “That one act _epitomizes_ her philosophy of life.” If you cut everything else away to get to the _essential_ part, that part is a representative cross-section of the whole. So a woman who is the _epitome_ of kindness stands for all people who are kind; and an act that _epitomizes_ a philosophy of life represents, by itself, the complete philosophy.

**3. love and words**

_Logos_, we know, means _science_ or _study;_ it may also mean _word_ or _speech_, as it does in _philology_ (fƏ-LOL′-Ə-jee), etymologically _the love of words_ (from Greek _philein_, to love, plus _logos_), or what is more commonly called _linguistics_ (ling-GWIS′-tiks), the science of language, a term derived from Latin _lingua_, tongue.

Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of _philology?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**4. more love**

_Philanthropy_ (fƏ-LAN′-thrƏ-pee) is by etymology the love of mankind—one who devotes oneself to _philanthropy_ is a _philanthropist_ (fƏ-LAN′-thrƏ-pist), as we learned in Chapter 3; the adjective is _philanthropic_ (fil-Ən-THROP′-ik).

The verb _philander_ (fƏ-LAN′-dƏr), to “play around” sexually, be promiscuous, or have extramarital relations, combines _philein_ with _andros_, male. (_Philandering_, despite its derivation, is not of course exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, derived from the proper name conventionally given to male lovers in plays and romances of the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages in the interesting activities catalogued above is a _philanderer_ (fƏ-LAN′-dƏr-Ər).

By etymology, _philosophy_ is the love of wisdom (Greek _sophos_, wise); _Philadelphia_ is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek _adelphos_, brother); _philharmonic_ is the love of music or harmony (Greek _harmonia_, harmony); and a _philter_, a rarely used word, is a love potion. Today we call whatever arouses sexual desire a&#x6E;_&#x61;phrodisiac_ (af′-rƏ-DIZ′-ee-ak′), from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty.

_Aphrodisiac_ is an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer adjective form, _aphrodisiacal_ (af′-rƏ-dƏ-ZĪ′-Ə-kƏl), is also used.

A _bibliophile_ (BIB′-lee-Ə-fīl′) is one who loves books as collectibles, admiring their binding, typography, illustrations, rarity, etc.—in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek _biblion_, book.

An _Anglophile_ (ANG′-glƏ-fīl′) admires and is fond of the British people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin _Anglus_, English.

**5. words and how they affect people**

The _semanticist_ is professionally involved in _semantics_ (sƏ-MAN′-tiks). The adjective is _semantic_ (sƏ-MAN′-tik) or _semantical_ (sƏ-MAN′-tƏ-kƏl).

_Semantics_, like _orthopedics, pediatrics_, and _obstetrics_, is a singular noun despite the -_s_ ending. Semantics _is_, not _are_, an exciting study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word as a science or area of study. In the following sentence, _semantics_ is used as a plural: “The _semantics_ of your thinking _are_ all wrong.”

Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well worth a visit to the library to pick up, are _Language in Thought and Action_, by S. I. Hayakawa, and _People in Quandaries_, by Dr. Wendell Johnson.

**6. how people live**

The profession of the _sociologist_ is _sociology_ (sō′-shee-OL′-Ə-jee _or_ sō-see-OL′-Ə-jee). Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

_Sociology_ is built on Latin _socius_, companion,<sup>1</sup> plus _logos_, science, study. _Socius_ is the source of such common words as _associate, social, socialize, society, sociable_, and _antisocial;_ as well as _asocial_ (ay-SŌ′-shƏl), which combines the negative prefix _a_- with _socius._

The _antisocial_ person actively dislikes people, and often behaves in ways that are detrimental or destructive to society or the social order (_anti_-, against).

On the other hand, someone who is _asocial_ is withdrawn and self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The _asocial_ person doesn’t want to “get involved.”

#### TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST

1\. Recalling the root _sophos_, wise, and thinking of the English word _moron_, write the name given to a second-year student in high school or college: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Etymologically, what does this word mean? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2\. Based on the root _sophos_, what word means _worldly-wise?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. Thinking of _bibliophile_, define _bibliomaniac:_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. These three words, based on _lingua_, tongue, use prefixes we have discussed. Can you define each one?

| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| (b) bilingual   | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (c) trilingual  | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |

Can you, now, guess at the meaning of _multilingual?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

How about _linguist?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

What do you suppose the Latin root _multus_ means? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (Think of _multitude._)

(_Answers in Chapter 18_)

#### WHERE TO GET NEW IDEAS

People with superior vocabularies, I have submitted, are the people with ideas. The words they know are verbal symbols of the ideas they are familiar with—reduce one and you must reduce the other, for ideas cannot exist without verbalization. Freud oncehad an idea—and had to coin a whole new vocabulary to make his idea clear to the world. Those who are familiar with Freud’s theories know all the words that explain them—the _unconscious_, the _ego_, the _id_, the _superego, rationalization, Oedipus complex_, and so on. Splitting the atom was once a new idea—anyone familiar with it knew something about _fission, isotope, radioactive, cyclotron_, etc.

Remember this: your vocabulary indicates the alertness and range of your mind. The words you know show the extent of your understanding of what’s going on in the world. The size of your vocabulary varies directly with the degree to which you are growing intellectually.

You have covered so far in this book several hundred words. Having learned these words, you have begun to think of an equal number of new ideas. A new word is not just another pattern of syllables with which to clutter up your mind—a new word is a new idea to help you think, to help you understand the thoughts of others, to help you express your own thoughts, to help you live a richer intellectual life.

Realizing these facts, you may become impatient. You will begin to doubt that a book like this can cover all the ideas that an alert and intellectually mature adult wishes to be acquainted with. Your doubt is well-founded.

One of the chief purposes of this book is to get you started, to give you enough of a push so that you will begin to gather momentum, to stimulate you enough so that you will want to start gathering your own ideas.

_Where can you gather them?_ From good books on new topics.

_How can you gather them?_ By reading on a wide range of new subjects.

Reference has repeatedly been made to psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis in these pages. If your curiosity has been piqued by these references, here is a good place to start. In these fields there is a tremendous and exciting literature—and you can read as widely and as deeply as you wish.

What I would like to do is offer a few suggestions as to where you might profitably begin—how far you go will depend on your own interest.

I suggest, first, half a dozen older books (older, but still immensely valuable and completely valid) available at any large public library.

_The Human Mind_, by Karl A. Menninger

_Mind and Body_, by Flanders Dunbar

_The Mind in Action_, by Eric Berne

_Understandable Psychiatry_, by Leland E. Hinsie

_A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis_, by Sigmund Freud

_Emotional Problems of Living_, by O. Spurgeon English and Gerald H. J. Pearson

Next, I suggest books on some of the newer approaches in psychology. These are available in inexpensive paperback editions as well as at your local library.

_I Ain’t Well—But I Sure Am Better_, by Jess Lair, Ph.D.

_The Disowned Self_, by Nathaniel Brandon

_A Primer of Behavioral Psychology_, by Adelaide Bry

_I’m OK—You’re OK_, by Thomas A. Harris, M.D.

_Freedom to Be_ and _Man the Manipulator_, by Everett L. Shostrum

_Games People Play_, by Eric Berne, M.D.

_Love and Orgasm, Pleasure_ and _The Language of the Body_, by Alexander Lowen, M.D.

_The Transparent Self_, by Sydney M. Jourard

_Don’t Say Yes When You Want to Say No_, by Herbert Fensterheim and Jean Baer

_Gestalt Therapy Verbatim_, by Frederick S. Perls

_Born to Win_, by Muriel James and Dorothy Jongeward

_Joy_ and _Here Comes Everybody_, by William C. Schutz

_The Fifty-Minute Hour_, by Robert Lindner

(_End of Session 13_)

<sup>1</sup> _Companion_ itself has an interesting etymology—Latin _com_-, with, plus _panis_, bread. If you are social, you enjoy breaking bread with companions. _Pantry_ also comes from _panis_, though far more than bread is stored there.
