TEASER PREVIEW

What kind of liar are you if you:

• _have developed a reputation for falsehood?_

• _are particularly skillful?_

• _cannot be reformed?_

• _have become habituated to your vice?_

• _started to lie from the moment of your birth?_

• _always lie?_

• _cannot distinguish fact from fancy?_

• _suffer no pangs of conscience?_

• _are suspiciously smooth and fluent in your lying?_

• _tell vicious lies?_

### SESSION 14 <a href="#page149" id="page149"></a>

It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who went around the streets of Athens, lantern in hand, looking for an honest person.

This was over two thousand years ago, but I presume that Diogenes would have as little success in his search today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character—I doubt that few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally.

Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape punishment, to gain an end that would otherwise be denied them, out of long-standing habit, or sometimes because they actually do not know the difference between fact and fancy. These are the common reasons for falsification. No doubt there are other, fairly unique, motives that impel people to distort the truth. And, to come right down to it, can we always be certain what is true and what is false?

If lying is a prevalent and all-too-human phenomenon, there would of course be a number of interesting words to describe different types of liars.

Let us pretend (not to get personal, but only to help you become personally involved in the ideas and words) that you are a liar.

The question is, what kind of liar _are_ you?

#### IDEAS <a href="#page150" id="page150"></a>

**1. you don’t fool even some of the people**

Everybody knows your propensity for avoiding facts. You have built so solid and unsavory a reputation that only a stranger is likely to be misled—and then, not for long.

A _notorious_ liar

**2. to the highest summits of artistry**

Your ability is top-drawer—rarely does anyone lie as convincingly or as artistically as you do. Your skill has, in short, reached the zenith of perfection. Indeed, your mastery of the art is so great that your lying is almost always crowned with success—and you have no trouble seducing an unwary listener into believing that you are telling gospel truth.

A _consummate_ liar

**3. beyond redemption or salvation**

You are impervious to correction. Often as you may be caught in your fabrications, there is no reforming you—you go right on lying despite the punishment, embarrassment, or unhappiness that your distortions of truth may bring upon you.

An _incorrigible_ liar

**4. too old to learn new tricks**

You are the victim of firmly fixed and deep-rooted habits. Telling untruths is as frequent and customary an activity as brushing your teeth in the morning, or having toast and coffee for breakfast, or lighting up a cigarette after dinner (if you are a smoker). And almost as reflexive.

An _inveterate_ liar

**5. an early start**

You have such a long history of persistent falsification that one can only suspect that your vice started when you were reposing in your mother’s womb. In other words, and allowing for a great deal of exaggeration for effect, you have been lying from the moment of your birth.

A _congenital_ liar

**6. no letup**

You never stop lying. While normal people lie on occasion, and often for special reasons, you lie continually—not occasionally or even frequently, but over and over.

A _chronic_ liar

**7. a strange disease**

You are not concerned with the difference between truth and falsehood; you do not bother to distinguish fact from fantasy. In fact, your lying is a disease that no antibiotic can cure.

A _pathological_ liar

**8. no regrets**

You are completely without a conscience. No matter what misery your fabrications may cause your innocent victims, you never feel the slightest twinge of guilt. Totally unscrupulous, you are a dangerous person to get mixed up with.

An _unconscionable_ liar

**9. smooth!**

Possessed of a lively imagination and a ready tongue, you can distort facts as smoothly and as effortlessly as you can say your name. But you do not always get away with your lies.

Ironically enough, it is your very smoothness that makes you suspect: your answers are too quick to be true. Even if we can’t immediately catch you in your lies, we have learned from unhappy past experience not to suspend our critical faculties when you are talking. We admire your nimble wit, but we listen with a skeptical ear.

A _glib_ liar

**10. outstanding!**

Lies, after all, are bad—they are frequently injurious to other people, and may have a particularly dangerous effect on you as a liar. At best, if you are caught you suffer some embarrassment. At worst, if you succeed in your deception your character becomes warped and your sense of values suffers. Almost all lies are harmful; some are no less than vicious.

If you are one type of liar, _all_ your lies are vicious—calculatedly, predeterminedly, coldly, and advisedly vicious. In short, your lies are so outstandingly hurtful that people gasp in amazement and disgust at hearing them.

An _egregious_ liar

In this chapter the ten basic words revolve rather closely around a central core. Each one, however, has a distinct, a unique meaning, a special implication. Note the differences.

| TYPE OF LIAR          | SPECIAL IMPLICATION                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   1. _notorious_      | _famous_—or _infamous_—for lying; tendency to falsify is _well-known_                  |
|   2. _consummate_     | great _skill_                                                                          |
|   3. _incorrigible_   | too far gone to be _reformed—impervious to rehabilitation_                             |
|   4. _inveterate_     | lying has become a _deep-rooted habit_                                                 |
|   5. _congenital_     | lying had _very early beginnings_—as if _from birth_                                   |
| 6. _chronic_          | _over and over_                                                                        |
|   7. _pathological_   | an irresistible _compulsion_ to lie—often for no rational reason; lying is a _disease_ |
|   8. _unconscionable_ | _lack of regret or remorse_                                                            |
|   9. _glib_           | great _smoothness_                                                                     |
| 10. _egregious_       | _viciousness_ of the lies                                                              |

These ten expressive adjectives, needless to say, are not restricted to lying or liars. Note their general meanings:

|   1. _notorious_      | well-known for some bad quality—a _notorious_ philanderer                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   2. _consummate_     | perfect, highly skilled—_consummate_ artistry at the keyboard                                                                        |
|   3. _incorrigible_   | beyond reform—an _incorrigible_ optimist                                                                                             |
|   4. _inveterate_     | long-accustomed, deeply habituated—an _inveterate_ smoker (this adjective, like _notorious_, usually has an unfavorable connotation) |
|   5. _congenital_     | happening at or during birth–a _congenital_ deformity                                                                                |
|   6. _chronic_        | going on for a long time, or occurring again and again—_chronic_ appendicitis                                                        |
|   7. _pathological_   | diseased—a _pathological_ condition                                                                                                  |
|   8. _unconscionable_ | without pangs of conscience–_unconscionable_ cruelty to children                                                                     |
|   9. _glib_           | smooth, suspiciously fluent–a _glib_ witness                                                                                         |
| 10. _egregious_       | outstandingly bad or vicious–an _egregious_ error                                                                                    |

With the exception of _consummate_ and _congenital_, all ten adjectives have strongly derogatory implications and are generally used to describe people, characteristics, or conditions we disapprove of.

(_End of Session 14_)

### SESSION 15

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. well-known**

“Widely but unfavorably known” is the common definition for _notorious._ Just as a _notorious_ liar is well-known for unreliable statements, so a _notorious_ gambler, a _notorious_ thief, or a _notoriou&#x73;_&#x6B;iller has achieved a wide reputation for some form of antisocial behavior. The noun is _notoriety_ (nō-tƏ-RĪ′-Ə-tee).

The derivation is from Latin _notus_, known, from which we also get _noted._ It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a change of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an admirer of certain business executives will speak of them as “_noted_ industrialists”; these same people’s enemies will call them “_notorious_ exploiters.” Similarly, if we admire a man’s or a woman’s unworldliness, we refer to it by the complimentary term _childlike;_ but if we are annoyed by the trait, we describe it, derogatively, as _childish._ Change “-like” to “-ish” and our emotional tone undergoes a complete reversal.

**2. plenty of room at the top**

The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the _summit_, a word derived from Latin _summus_, highest, which also gives us the mathematical term _sum_, as in addition. A _consummate_ artist has reached the very highest point of perfection; and to _consummate_ (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt) a marriage, a business deal, or a contract is, etymologically, to bring it to the highest point; that is, to put the final touches to it, to bring it to completion.

\[Note how differently _consummate_ (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt), the adjective, is pronounced from the verb to _consummate_ (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt)].

Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun suffix -_ness: sweet—sweetness; simple—simpleness; envious—enviousness;_ etc.

Many adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the adjective _consummate_ is one of them. To make a noun out of _consummate_, add either -_ness_ or -_acy; consummateness_ (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt-nƏs) or _consummacy_ (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏ-see).

Verbs ending in -_ate_ invariably tack on the noun suffix -_ion_ to form nouns: _create—creation; evaluate—evaluation;_ etc.

Can you write the noun form of the verb to _consummate?_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**3. no help**

Call people _incorrigible_ (in-KAWR′-Ə-jƏ-bƏl) if they do anything to excess, and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to no avail. Thus, one can be an _incorrigible_ idealist, an _incorrigible_ criminal, an _incorrigible_ optimist, or an _incorrigible_ philanderer. The word derives from Latin _corrigo_, to correct or set straight, plus the negative prefix _in_-. (This prefix, depending on the root it precedes, may be negative, may intensify the root, as in _invaluable_, or may mean _in._)

The noun is _incorrigibility_ (in-kawr′-Ə-jƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee) or, alternatively, _incorrigibleness._

**4. veterans**

_Inveterate_, from Latin _vetus_, old,<sup>1</sup> generally indicates disapproval.

_Inveterate_ gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically speaking; _inveterate_ drinkers have been imbibing for so long that they, too, have formed old, well-established habits; and _inveterate_ liars have been lying for so long, and their habits are by now so deep-rooted, that one can scarcely remember (the word implies) when they ever told the truth.

The noun is _inveteracy_ (in-VET′-Ər-Ə-see) or _inveterateness._

A _veteran_ (VET′-Ə-rƏn), as of the Armed Forces, grew older serving the country; otherwise a _veteran_ is an old hand at the game (and therefore skillful). The word is both a noun and an adjective: a _veteran_ at (or in) swimming, tennis, police work, business, negotiations, diplomacy—or a _veteran_ actor, teacher, diplomat, political reformer.

**5. birth**

Greek _genesis_, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discussing _psychogenic_ (Chapter 5), is the source of a great many English words.

_Genetics_ (jƏ-NET′-iks) is the science that treats of the transmission of hereditary characteristics from parents to offspring. The scientist specializing in the field is a _geneticist_ (jƏ-NET′-Ə-sist), the adjective is _genetic_ (jƏ-NET′-ik). The particle in the chromosome of the germ cell containing a hereditary characteristic is a _gene_ (JEEN).

_Genealogy_ (jeen′-ee-AL′-Ə-jee) is the study of family trees or ancestral origins (_logos_, study). The practitioner is a _genealogist_ (jeen′-ee-AL′-Ə-jist). Can you form the adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (And can you pronounce it?)

The _genital_ (GEN′-Ə-tƏl), or sexual, organs are involved in the process of conception and birth. The _genesis_ (JEN′-Ə-sis) of anything—a plan, idea, thought, career, etc.—is its beginning, birth, or origin, and _Genesis_, the first book of the Old Testament, describes the creation, or birth, of the universe.

_Congenital_ is constructed by combining the prefix _con_-, with or together, and the root _genesis_, birth.

So a _congenital_ defect, deformity, condition, etc. occurs during the nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become technical). _Hereditary_ (hƏ-RED′-Ə-tair′-ee) characteristics, on the other hand, are acquired at the moment of conception. Thus, eye color, nose shape, hair texture, and other such qualities are _hereditary;_ they are determined by the _genes_ in the germ cells of the mother and father. But a thalidomide baby resulted from the use of the drug by a pregnant woman, so the deformities were _congenital._

_Congenital_ is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality occurring during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly exaggerates, for effect, the very early existence of some quality: _congenital_ liar, _congenital_ fear of the dark, etc.

### SESSION 16

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. of time and place**

A _chronic_ liar lies constantly, again and again and again; a _chronic_ invalid is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The derivation of the word is Greek _chronos_, time. The noun form is _chronicity_ (krƏ-NIS′-Ə-tee).

An _anachronism_ (Ə-NAK′-rƏ-niz-Əm) is someone or something out of time, out of date, belonging to a different era, either earlieror later. (The prefix _ana_- like _a_-, is negative.) The adjective is _anachronous_ (Ə-NAK′-rƏ-nƏs) or _anachronistic_ (Ə-nak′-rƏ-NIS′-tik).

Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan some Sunday. You will see horse-drawn carriages with top-hatted coachmen—a vestige of the 1800s. Surrounded by twentieth-century motorcars and modern skyscrapers, these romantic vehicles of a bygone era are _anachronous._

Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV set. An _anachronism!_

Your friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living in the time of Shakespeare. Another _anachronism!_

Science fiction is deliberately _anachronous_—it deals with phenomena, gadgetry, accomplishments far off (possibly) in the future.

An _anachronism_ is out of _time;_ something out of _place_ is _incongruous_ (in-KONG′-gr-Əs), a word combining the negative prefix _in_-, the prefix _con_-, with or together, and a Latin verb meaning to _agree_ or _correspond._

Thus, it is _incongruous_ to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal wedding; it is _anachronous_ to wear the wasp waist, conspicuous bustle, or powdered wig of the eighteenth century. The noun form of _incongruous_ is _incongruity_ (in-kƏng-GR′-Ə-tee).

_Chronological_ (kron-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl), in correct time order, comes from _chronos._ To tell a story _chronologically_ is to relate the events in the time order of their occurrence. _Chronology_ (krƏ-NOL′-Ə-jee) is the science of time order and the accurate dating of events (_logos_, science)—the expert in this field is a _chronologist_ (krƏ-NOL′-Ə-jist)—or a list of events in the time order in which they have occurred or will occur.

A _chronometer_ (krƏ-NOM′-Ə-tƏr), combining _chronos_ with _metron_, measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one used on ships. _Chronometry_ (krƏ-NOM′-Ə-tree) is the measurement of time—the adjective is _chronometric_ (kron′-Ə-MET′-rik).

Add the prefix _syn_-, together, plus the verb suffix -_ize_, to _chronos_, and you have constructed _synchronize_ (SIN′-krƏ-nīz′), etymologically _to time together_, or to move, happen, or cause to happen, at the same time or rate. If you and your friend _synchroniz&#x65;_&#x79;our watches, you set them at the same time. If you _synchronize_ the activity of your arms and legs, as in swimming, you move them at the same time or rate. The adjective is _synchronous_ (SIN′-krƏ-nƏs); the noun form of the verb _synchronize_ is _synchronization_ (sin′-krƏ-nƏ-ZAY′-shƏn).

**2. disease, suffering, teeling**

_Pathological_ is _diseased_ (a _pathological_ condition)—this meaning of the word ignores the root _logos_, science, study.

_Pathology_ (pƏ-THOL′-Ə-jee) _is_ the science or study of disease—its nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another meaning of the noun ignores _logos_, and _pathology_ may be any morbid, diseased, or abnormal physical condition or conditions; in short, simply _disease_, as in “This case involves so many kinds of _pathology_ that several different specialists are working on it.”

A _pathologist_ (pƏ-THOL′-Ə-jist) is an expert who examines tissue, often by autopsy or biopsy, to diagnose disease and interpret the abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific diseases.

_Pathos_ occurs in some English words with the additional meaning of _feeling._ If you feel or suffer with someone, you are _sympathetic_ (sim-pƏ-THET′-ik)—_sym_- is a respelling before the letter _p_ of the Greek prefix _syn_-, with or together. The noun is _sympathy_ (SIM′-pƏ-thee), the verb _sympathize_ (SIM′-pƏ-thīz). Husbands, for example, so the story goes, may have _sympathetic_ labor pains when their wives are about to deliver.

The prefix _anti_-, you will recall, means _against._ If you experience _antipathy_ (an-TIP′-Ə-thee) to people or things, you feel _against_ them—you feel strong dislike or hostility. The adjective is _antipathetic_ (an′-tƏ-pƏ-THET′-ik), as in “an _antipathetic_ reaction to an authority figure.”

But you may have _no_ feeling at all—just indifference, lack of any interest, emotion, or response, complete listlessness, especially when some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are _apathetic_ (ap-Ə-THET′-ik); _a_-, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun is _apathy_ (AP′-Ə-thee), as in voter _apathy_, student _apathy_, etc.

On the other hand, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that you not only share the feelings of another, but you also _identify_ with those feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if momentarily you were that other person. What you have, then, is _empathy_ (EM′-pƏ-thee); you _empathize_ (EM′-pƏ-thīz′), you are _empathetic_ (em-pƏ-THET′-ik), or, to use an alternate adjective, _empathic_ (em-PATH′-ik). _Em_- is a respelling before the letter _p_ of the Greek prefix _en_-, in.

Someone is _pathetic_ (pƏ-THET′-ik) who is obviously suffering—such a person may arouse sympathy or pity (or perhaps _antipathy?_) in you. A _pathetic_ story is about suffering and, again, is likely to arouse sadness, sorrow, or pity.

Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J. B. Rhine and his associates at Duke University on extrasensory perception; you will find an interesting account of Rhine’s work in his book _The Reach of the Mind._ What makes it possible for two people separated by miles of space to communicate with each other without recourse to messenger, telephone, telegraph, or postal service? It can be done, say the believers in _telepathy_ (tƏ-LEP′-Ə-thee), also called _mental telepathy_, though they do not yet admit to knowing how. How can one person read the mind of another? Simple—by being _telepathic_ (tel-Ə-PATH′-ik), but no one can explain the chemistry or biology of it. _Telepathy_ is built by combining _pathos_, feeling, with the prefix _tele_-, distance, the same prefix we found in _telephone, telegraph, telescope._

_Telepathic_ (tel-Ə-PATH′-ik) communication occurs when people can _feel_ each other’s thoughts from a distance, when they have ESP.

### SESSION 17

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. knowing**

Psychopaths commit antisocial and _unconscionable_ acts—they are not troubled by _conscience_, guilt, remorse, etc. over what they have done.

_Unconscionable_ and _conscience_ are related in derivation—the first word from Latin _scio_, to know, the second from Latin _sciens_, knowing, and both using the prefix _con_-, with, together.

Etymologically, then, your _conscience_ is your knowledge _with_ a moral sense of right and wrong; if you are _unconscionable_, your conscience is not (_un_-) working, or you have no conscience. Thenoun form is _unconscionableness_ or _unconscionability_ (un-kon′-shƏ-nƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee).

_Conscious_, also from _con_- plus _scio_, is knowledge or awareness of one’s emotions or sensations, or of what’s happening around one.

_Science_, from _sciens_, is systematized _knowledge_ as opposed, for example, to belief, faith, intuition, or guesswork.

Add Latin _omnis_, all, to _sciens_, to construct _omniscient_ (om-NISH′-Ənt), all-knowing, possessed of infinite knowledge. The noun is _omniscience_ (om-NISH′-Əns).

Add the prefix _pre_-, before, to _sciens_, to construct _prescient_ (PREE′-shƏnt)—knowing about events _before_ they occur, i.e., psychic, or possessed of unusual powers of prediction. The noun is _prescience_ (PREE′-shƏns).

And, finally, add the negative prefix _ne_- to _sciens_ to produce _nescient_ (NESH′-Ənt), not knowing, or ignorant. Can you, by analogy with the previous two words, write the noun form of _nescient?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (Can you pronounce it?)

**2. fool some of the people…**

_Glib_ is from an old English root that means _slippery. Glib_ liars or _glib_ talkers are smooth and slippery; they have ready answers, fluent tongues, a persuasive air—but, such is the implication of the word, they fool only the most _nescient_, for their smoothness lacks sincerity and conviction.

The noun is _glibness._

**3. herds and flocks**

_Egregious_ (remember the pronunciation? Ə-GREE′-jƏs) is from Latin _grex, gregis_, herd or flock. An _egregious_ lie, act, crime, mistake, etc. is so exceptionally vicious that it conspicuously stands _out_ (_e_-, a shortened form of the prefix _ex_-, out) from the _herd_ or _flock_ of other bad things.

The noun is _egregiousness_ (Ə-GREE′-jƏs-nƏs).

A person who enjoys companionship, who, etymologically, likes to be with the herd, who reaches out for friends and is happiestwhen surrounded by people—such a person is _gregarious_ (grƏ-GAIR′-ee-Əs).

Extroverts are of course _gregarious_—they prefer human contact, conversation, laughter, interrelationships, to solitude.

The suffix -_ness_, as you know, can be added to an adjective to construct a noun form. Write the noun for _gregarious:_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Add the prefix _con_-, with, together, to _grex, gregis_, to get the verb _congregate_ (KONG′-grƏ-gayt′); add the prefix _se_-, apart, to build the verb _segregate_ (SEG′-rƏ-gayt′); add the prefix _ad_-, to, toward (_ad_- changes to _ag_- before a root starting with _g_-), to construct the verb _aggregate_ (AG-rƏ-gayt′).

Let’s see what we have. When people gather _together_ in a _herd_ or _flock_, they (write the verb) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The noun is _congregation_ (cong′-grƏ-GAY′-shƏn), one of the meanings of which is a religious “flock.”

Put people or things apart from the _herd_, and you (write the verb) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ them. Can you construct the noun by adding the suitable noun suffix? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Bring individual items to or toward the _herd_ or _flock_, and you (write the verb) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ them. What is the noun form of this verb? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The verb _aggregate_ also means _to come together to or toward the herd_, that is, _to gather into a mass or whole_, or by extension, _to total or amount to._ So _aggregate_, another noun form, pronounced AG′-rƏ-gƏt, is a group or mass of individuals considered as a whole, a _herd_, or a _flock_, as in the phrase “people in the _aggregate_…”

#### TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST

1\. “She was one of many _notables_ who attended the convention.” Recognizing that the italicized word is built on the root _notus_, can you define the noun _notable_ in the context of _known? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

2\. _Notify_ and _notice_ derive from the same root. Can you define these two words, again in the context of _known? Notify:_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. _Notice:_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.What do you supose the verb suffix -_fy_ of _notify_ means? (Think also of _simplify, clarify, liquefy_, etc.) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. You are familiar with the roots _chronos_ and _graphein._ Suppose you came across the word _chronograph_ in your reading. Can you make an educated guess as to the meaning? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. Recognizing the root _genesis_ in the verb _generate_, how would you define the word? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

How about _regenerate?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

What do you suppose the prefix _re_- means?\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

5\. Recognizing the root _omnis_ in _omnipotent_ and _omnipresent_, can you define the words?

_Omnipotent:_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

_Omnipresent:_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Recalling how we formed a noun from the adjective _omniscient_, write the noun forms of:

Omnipotent: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Omnipresent: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

6\. Think of the negative prefix in _anachronism;_ think next of the noun _aphrodisiac._ Can you construct a word for _that which reduces or eliminates sexual desire? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

#### FOUR LASTING BENEFITS

You know by now that it is easy to build your vocabulary if you work diligently and intelligently. Diligence is important—to come to the book occasionally is to learn new words and ideas in anaimless fashion, rather than in the continuous way that characterizes the natural, uninterrupted, intellectual growth of a child. (You will recall that children are top experts in increasing their vocabularies.) And an intelligent approach is crucial—new words can be completely understood and permanently remembered only as symbols of vital ideas, never if memorized in long lists of isolated forms.

If you have worked diligently and intelligently, you have done much more than merely learned a few hundred new words. Actually, I needn’t tell you what else you’ve accomplished, since, if you really have accomplished it, you can feel it for yourself; but it may be useful if I verbalize the feelings you may have.

In addition to learning the meanings, pronunciation, background, and use of 300–350 valuable words, you have:

1\. _Begun to sense a change in your intellectual atmosphere_. (You have begun to do your thinking with many of the words, with many of the ideas behind the words. You have begun to use the words in your speech and writing, and have become alert to their appearance in your reading.)

2\. _Begun to develop a new interest in words as expressions of ideas._

3\. _Begun to be aware of the new words you hear and that you see in your reading._

4\. _Begun to gain a new feeling for the relationship between words._ (For you realize that many words are built on roots from other languages and are related to other words which derive from the same roots.)

Now, suppose we pause to see how successful your learning has been.

In the next chapter, I offer you a comprehensive test on the first part of your work.

<sup>1</sup> Latin _senex_, source of _senile_ and _senescent_, also, you will recall, means _old._ In _inveterate, in_- means _in;_ it is not the negative prefix found in _incorrigible._
