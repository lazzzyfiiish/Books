### SESSION 45 <a href="#page479" id="page479"></a>

There are thousands of English words that end in the letters -_ous_—a Latin suffix meaning _full of._

The central theme about which the words in this chapter revolve is the idea of “fullness”—and as you will shortly see, you can be full of compliance and servility; full of complaints; full of snobbery; full of noise; full of no money; full of horsemanship; full of harmlessness; full of liquor; full of deathly pallor; and full of sorrows.

For each of these ideas English has a word—and the person with a rich vocabularly knows the exact word to describe what someone is full of.

#### IDEAS

**1. compliance**

The Latin root _sequor_ means _to follow_—and those who follow rather than lead are usually in a menial, subordinate, or inferior position. People who engage in certain fields of endeavor—waiters, clerks, and servants, for example—are forced, often contrary to their natural temperaments, to act excessively courteous, pleasant, obliging, even subservient and humble. They must follow the lead of their customers or employers, bending their own wills according to the desires of those they serve. They are, etymologically, _full of following after_, or—

_obsequious_

**RELATED WORDS:**

1\. _obsequies_—In a funeral cortege, the mourners _follow after_ the corpse. Hence, _obsequies_ are the burial ceremonies, the funeral rites.

2\. _subsequent_—A _subsequent_ letter, paragraph, time, etc. is one that _follows_ another.

3\. _sequel_—A _sequel_ may be a literary work, such as a novel, that _follows_ another, continuing the same subject, dealing with the same people or village, etc. or it may be an occurrence that grows out of or _follows_ another, as in, “Just wait until you hear the _sequel_ to the story!”

4\. _sequence_—In order, one item _following_ another, as in, “The _sequence_ of events of the next few days left him breathless.”

Any other word containing the root _sequ_- is likely to have some relationship to the idea of _following._

**2. complaints**

The Latin root _queror_ means _to complain_—and anyone full of complaints, constantly nagging, harping, fretful, petulant, whining, never satisfied, may accordingly be called—

_querulous_

**3. snobbery**

The Latin root _cilium_ means _eyelid; super_ means _above;_ and above the eyelid, as anyone can plainly see, is the eyebrow. Now there are certain obnoxious people who go around raising their eyebrows in contempt, disdain, and sneering arrogance at ordinary mortals like you and me. Such contemptuous, sneering, overbearingly conceited people are called—

_supercilious_

**4. noise**

The Latin root _strepo_ means _to make a noise._ Anyone who is unruly, boisterous, resistant to authority, unmanageable—and in a noisy, troublesome manner—is

_obstreperous_

**5. moneyless**

The Latin root _pecus_ means _cattle_—and at one time in human history a person’s wealth was measured not by stocks and bonds but by stocks of domestic animals, which was a lot more logical, since you get milk and leather and meat from cattle—true wealth—and all you get from the stock market is a headache.

Someone who had lots of _pecus_, then, was rich—someone without _pecus_ was indigent, destitute, “broke.” And so today we call someone who is habitually without funds, who seems generally to be full of a complete lack of money—

_impecunious_

This word is not a synonym of _indigent, destitute, or poverty-stricken;_ it does not necessarily imply living in reduced circumstances or want, but quite simply being short of cash—habitually.

RELATED WORD:

1\. _pecuniary_—pertaining to money, as in, a _pecuniary_ consideration, _pecuniary_ affairs, etc.

**6. horses**

The French word _cheval_ means _horse;_ and in medieval times only gentlemen and knights rode on horses—common people walked. Traditionally (but not, I understand, actually) knights were courteous to women, attentive to female desires, and self-sacrificing when their own interests came in conflict with those of the fair sex. Hence, we call a modern man who has a knightly attitude to women—

_chivalrous_

RELATED WORD:

(_Cheval_, horse, comes from Latin _caballus_, an inferior horse. _Callabus_ is found in English words in the spelling _caval_-.)

1\. _cavalcade_—A procession of persons on horseback, as in a parade.

2\. _cavalier_—As a noun, a _cavalier_ was once a mounted soldier.As an adjective, _cavalier_ describes actions and attitudes that are haughty, unmindful of others’ feelings, too offhand, such attributes often being associated with people in power (the military being one of the powers-that-be). Thus, “He answered in a _cavalier_ manner” would signify that he was arrogant in his answer, as if the questioner were taking a little too much privilege with him. Or, “After the _cavalier_ treatment I received, I never wished to return,” signifying that I was pretty much made to feel unimportant and inferior. Or, “After her _cavalier_ refusal, I’ll never invite her to another party,” signifying that the refusal was, perhaps, curt, offhand, without any attempt at apology or courtesy.

3\. _cavalry_—The mounted, or “horsed” part of an army.

4\. _chivalry_—Noun form of _chivalrous._ Can you write the alternate noun form ending in -_ness? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

5\. _chivalric_—Less commonly used adjective form, identical in meaning to _chivalrous._

Another Latin root for _horse_, as you know, is _equus_, found in words we have already discussed:

&#x20; 1\. _equestrian_—A horseman.

&#x20; 2\. _equestrienne_—A horsewoman.

&#x20; 3\. _equine_—Horselike.

**7. no harm done**

The latin root _noceo_ means to _injure;_ someone who need cause you no fear, so harmless is that person, so unable to interfere, so unlikely to get you into trouble, is called—

_innocuous_

RELATED WORDS:

1\. _innocent_—Not guilty of crime or injury.

2\. _noxious_—Harmful, poisonous; unwholesome.

**8. alcoholic**

The Latin root _bibo_ means to _drink;_ and one who is generally found with one foot up on the brass rail, who likes to tipple beyondthe point of sobriety—who, in short, has an overfondness for drinks with a pronounced alcoholic content, is called, usually humorously—

_bibulous_

RELATED WORD:

1\. _imbibe_—To drink in, soak up, absorb. If we use this verb without specifying what is drunk, as in, “He likes to _imbibe_,” the implication, of course, is always liquor; but _imbibe_ may also be used in patterns like “_imbibe_ learning” or “In early infancy she _imbibed_ a respect for her parents.”

2\. _bib_—Upper part of an apron, or an apronlike napkin tied around a child’s neck. In either case, the _bib_ prevents what is drunk (or eaten) from spilling over, or dribbling down, on the wearer’s clothing.

**9. like death itself**

The Latin root _cado_ means _to fall_—one’s final fall is of course always in death, and so someone who looks like a corpse (figuratively speaking), who is pale, gaunt, thin, haggard, eyes deep-sunk, limbs wasted, in other words the extreme opposite of the picture of glowing health, is called—

_cadaverous_

RELATED WORD:

1\. _cadaver_—A corpse, literally, especially one used for surgical dissection.

2\. _decadent_—Etymologically, “_falling down_” (_de_- is a prefix one meaning of which is _down_, as in _descend_, climb down; _decline_, turn down; etc.). If something is in a _decadent_ state, it is deteriorating, becoming corrupt or demoralized. _Decadence_ is a state of decay. Generally _decadent_ and _decadence_ are used figuratively—they refer not to actual physical decay (as of a dead body), but to moral or spiritual decay.

**10. pain and misery**

The Latin root _doleo_ means _to suffer_ or _grieve_—one who ismournful and sad, whose melancholy comes from physical pain or mental distress, who seems to be suffering or grieving, is called—

_dolorous_

RELATED WORD:

1\. _dolor_—A poetic synonym of _grief._

2\. _doleful_—A word referring somewhat humorously to exaggerated dismalness, sadness, or dreariness.

3\. _condole_—Etymologically, to suffer or grieve with (Latin _con_-, with, together). _Condole_ is a somewhat less commonly used synonym of _commiserate_, a verb we discussed in Chapter 15. The noun _condolence_ is much more frequently heard than the verb, as in, “Let me offer you my _condolences_,” usually said to someone mourning the death of a friend or relative. You have heard of _condolence_ cards, and no doubt have sent your share of them. When you _condole_ with somebody who has sustained a loss, usually by death, you are saying, in effect, “I am suffering or grieving with you.”

#### TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST

1\. In logic, a conclusion not based on the evidence is called a _non sequitur;_ by extension, the term is applied to any statement that appears to have no connection or relevance to what was said before. Knowing the root _sequor_, how would you define this term etymologically? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. _Sequor_, like many other Latin verbs, has another form somewhat differently spelled. (Remember _verto, versus_ and _loquor, locutus?_) The other form of _sequor_ is _secutus._ Can you define the following words in terms of the root?

| (a) second:      | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| (b) consecutive: | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (c) persecute:   | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (d) prosecute:   | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |

3\. Latin _super_, above or over, is used as a prefix in hundreds of English words. Can you figure out the word starting with _super_- that fits each etymological definition?

(a) above others (in quality, position, etc.) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(b) above the surface; not in depth (_adj._) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(c) (flowing) above what is necessary; more than needed (_adj._) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(d) above (or beyond) the natural (_adj._) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(e) to oversee; be in charge of (v.) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4\. _Cado_, to fall, is found in the following English words (sometimes the root is spelled -_cid_). Can you define each word in terms of its etymological parts?

| (a) cadence:     | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| (b) occidental:  | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (c) deciduous:   | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (d) incident:    | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (e) accident:    | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| (f) coincidence: | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |

5\. The negative prefix _in_- plus _doleo_, to suffer, forms an adjective that _etymologically_ means _not suffering_ (_pain_), but _actually_ means _idle; lazy; disliking effort or work._ Can you figure out the English word? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Can you write the noun form? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

6\. What does the feminine name Dolores mean etymologically? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
