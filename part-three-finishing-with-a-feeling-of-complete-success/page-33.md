#### CHAPTER 3:

1\. _Anthropocentric_ (an′-thrƏ-pƏ-SEN′-trik), an adjective built on _anthropos_, mankind; Greek _kentron_, center, and the adjective suffix -_ic_, describes thinking, assumptions, reasoning, etc. that see mankind as the central fact, or ultimate aim, of the universe. The noun forms are either _anthropocentrism_ (an′-thrƏ-pƏ-SEN′-triz-Əm) or _anthropocentricity_ (an′-thrƏ-pō′-sƏn-TRIS′-Ə-tee).

2\. _Andromania_ (an′-drƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə), a combination of _andros_, man (male), plus _mania_, madness, signifies an obsession with males. Person: _andromaniac_, one who is mad about men; adjective: _andromaniacal_ (an′-drƏ-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl).

3\. _Gynandrous_ (jī-NAN′-drƏs), combining _gyne_, woman, with _andros_, man (male), describes:

a. plants in which the male and female organs are united in the same column; _or_

b. people who physically have both male and female sexual organs, often one or both in rudimentary form; _or_

c. (_a more recent meaning_) people who exhibit, or are willing to own up to, the male _and_ female _emotional_ characteristics that everyone possesses.

The word may have the roots in reverse, becoming _androgynous_ (an-DROJ′-Ə-nƏs), with all three meanings identical to those of _gynandrous._

_Hermaphroditic_ (hur-maf′-rƏ-DIT′-ik), a combination of _Hermes_, the Greek god who served as messenger or herald (in Roman mythology, this god was known as _Mercury_, and is conventionally pictured with wings on his heels), and _Aphrodite_, the Greek goddess of love and beauty (in Roman mythology, _Venus_), has either of the first two meanings of _gynandrous._

The noun form of _gynandrous_ is _gynandry_ (jī-NAN′-dree); of _androgynous, androgyny_ (an-DROJ′-Ə-nee); of _hermaphroditic, hermaphroditism_ (hur-MAF′-rƏ-dī′-tiz-Əm).

The individual plant is an _andrognye_ (AN′-drƏ-jin); plant or person, a _hermaphrodite_ (hur-MAF′-rƏ-dīt′).

4\. _Monomania_ (mon-Ə-MAY′-nee-Ə), combining _monos_, one, and _mania_, madness, is an obsession with one thing, or obsessiveness in one area. Person: _monomaniac;_ adjective: _monomaniacal_ (mon′-Ə-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl).

5\. A _misandrist_ (mis-AN′-drist), combining _misein_, to hate, with _andros_, man (male), hates men. Noun: _misandry_ (mis-AN′-dree). Adjective: _misandrous_ (mis-AN′-drƏs).

#### CHAPTER 6:

1\. _Sophomore;_ from _sophos_ plus _moros_, foolish, the word etymologically designates one who is half wise and half foolish. The adjective _sophomoric_ (sof-Ə-MAWR′-ik) describes people, attitudes, statements, writings, etc. that are highly opinionated, self-assured, and coming off as if wise, but which in reality are immature, inexperienced, foolish, etc.

2\. _Sophisticated_ (sƏ-FIS′-tƏ-kay′-tƏd). The verb is _sophisticate_, the noun _sophistication._ One who is worldly-wise is a _sophisticate_ (sƏ-FIS′-tƏ-kƏt).

_Sophisticated_ has in recent years taken on the added meaning of _highly developed, mature, or complicated; appealing to a mature intellect; or aware and knowledgeable._ Examples: _sophisticated_ machinery, electronic equipment; a _sophisticated_ approach; a _sophisticated_ audience, group, staff, faculty, etc.

3\. One who is obsessed with books, especially with collecting books.

4\. (a) speaking one language, (b) speaking two languages, (c) speaking three languages.

_Multilingual_ (_multus_, many, plus _lingua_)—speaking many languages.

A _linguist_ is one who is fluent in many languages, or else an expert in _linguistics_ (or both).

_Multus_, as indicated, means _many_, as in _multitude, multiply, multiple, multicolored, multifarious, multilateral_, etc., etc.

5\. (a) France, (b) Russia, (c) Spain, (d) Germany, (e) Japan, (f) China.

6\. (a) _androphile_, (b) _gynephile_ (or _philogynist_), (c) _pedophile_, (d) _zoophile_, (e) _botanophile._

But _pedophilia_ (pee′-dƏ-FIL′-ee-Ə) is another story. A _pedophiliac_ sexually molests young children—such love little kids can do without!

#### CHAPTER 7:

1\. A _notable_ is someone well-_known._

2\. To _notify_ is, etymologically, to make _known—notus_ + -_fy_, a derivation of _facio_, to make.

_Notice_, as a noun, is what makes something _known; to notice_, as a verb, is to observe (something or someone) so that it, he, or she becomes _known_ to the observer.

-_Fy_, as a verb suffix, means _to make._ So _simplify_ is to make simple, _clarify_, to make clear; _liquefy_, to make liquid; _putrefy_, to make (or become) rotten or putrid; _stupefy_, to make stupid, or dumb, with astonishment (note the -_e_ preceding the suffix in _liquefy, putrefy, stupefy_); _fortify_, to make strong; _rectify_, to make right or correct; etc., etc.

3\. _Chronograph_ (KRON′-Ə-graf′) is an instrument that measures and records short intervals of time.

4\. To _generate_ is to give birth to, figuratively, or to create or produce, as a turbine _generates_ power, a person’s presence _generates_ fear, etc. The noun is _generation_, which, in another context, also designates the people born and living about the same time (the older, previous, or next _generation_, the Depression _generation_,etc.), or a period, conventionally set at about thirty years, between such groups of people.

To _regenerate_ is to give birth to again, or to be born again. Some creatures can _regenerate_ new limbs or parts if these are lost or cut off—or the limbs or parts _regenerate._

_Re_- means, of course, _again;_ or, in some words, as _recede, regress_, etc., _back._

5\. _Omnipotent_ (om-NIP′-Ə-tƏnt)—all-powerful; _omnis_ plus _potens, potentis_, powerful.

_Omnipresent_ (om′-nƏ-PREZ′-Ənt)—present all over, or everywhere.

Nouns: _omnipotence, omnipresence._

6\. _Anaphrodisiac_ (Ən-af′-rƏ-DIZ′-ee-ak′)—both a noun and an adjective. Saltpeter is supposedly an _anaphrodisiac;_ so, some people say, is a cold shower, which is highly doubtful. The best temporary _anaphrodisiac_ is probably sexual intercourse. Some women who were teen-agers when Elvis Presley was at the height of his popularity have told me that the young man’s gyrating hips were _aphrodisiacal_—I will take their word for it, as Elvis has never turned me on. On the other hand, if you want to talk about Diane Keaton or Raquel Welch … or especially Marilyn Monroe…

1\. _Magnanimity_ (mag′-nƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee). Adjective: _magnanimous_ (mag-NAN′-Ə-mƏs).

2\. _Bilateral_ (bī-LAT′-Ər-Əl), as in a _bilateral_ decision, i.e., one made by the two sides or two people involved. On the other hand, a _unilateral_ (y![](blob:moz-extension://95c76d74-e490-4d6a-85ca-b2d3597fcaba/093d41c9-83e9-4187-9951-6c53dd11b63d)-nƏ-LAT′-Ər-Əl) decision is made by _one_ person, without consultation with others.

3\. _Transcribe._ Noun: _transcription. A_ stenographer _transcribes_ shorthand notes into English words, or a musical _transcriber_ arranges or adapts a musical composition for an instrument, group, etc. other than the one for which the work was originally written.

4\. _Malaria_ was once thought to have been caused by the “bad air” of swamps; actually, it was (and is) transmitted to humans by infected anopheles mosquitoes breeding and living in swamps and other places where there is stagnant water.

5\. _Confection._ The word is hardly used much today with this meaning, except perhaps by members of an older generation who remember _confectioner’s_ shops and _confectionery_ stores. Now such places are called _ice cream stores_ (or _ice cream parlors_) and are run, at least on the west coast, by Baskin-Robbins or Farrell’s; or they are called _candy shops;_ or, when I was growing up, _candy stores_, where the kids all hung out, and candies could be bought for a penny apiece, with Hershey bars selling for a nickel (that’s why they are called “the good old days”).

#### CHAPTER 10:

1\. _Modus operandi._ Method (or mode) of working (or operating). Pronounced MŌ′-dƏs op′-Ə-RAN′-dī, the word is not, of course, restricted to the special methods used by a criminal, but may refer to the method or style of operating characteristic of any other professional. _Modus vivendi_ (MŌ′dƏs vƏ-VEN′-dī), etymologically “method of living,” is the style of life characteristic of a person or group.

2\. _Circumscription._ To _circumscribe_ also means, figuratively, to write (a line) _around_ (_one’s freedom of action_), so that one is restricted, limited, hemmed in, as in, “a life _circumscribed_ by poverty, by parental injunctions, or by an overactive conscience, etc.,” or “actions _circumscribed_ by legal restraints.” The noun _circumscription_ has the figurative meaning also.

3\. _Somniloquent_ (sƏm-NIL′-Ə-kwƏnt). Noun: _somniloquence_ (sƏm-NIL′-Ə-kwƏns) or _somniloquy_ (sƏm-NIL′-Ə-kwee), the latter noun also designating the words spoken by the sleeper. One who habitually talks while asleep is a _somniloquist_ (sƏm-NIL′-Ə-kwist).

4\. An _aurist_ is an ear specialist, more commonly called an _otologist_ (ō-TOL′-Ə-jist), from Greek _otos_, ear. Noun: _otology._ Adjective: _otological_ (ō-tƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

It is difficult at this point to resist telling a well-known story about medical specialists. In fact it’s impossible to resist, so here it is:

A dentist, doing his first extraction on a patient, was understandablynervous. When he got the molar out, his hand shook, he lost his grip on the instrument, and the tooth dropped down into the patient’s throat.

“Sorry,” said the doctor. “You’re outside my specialty now. You should see a laryngologist! \[lair′-ing-GOL′-Ə-jist—a larynx or throat specialist].”

By the time the unfortunate victim got to the laryngologist, the tooth had worked its way much further down.

The laryngologist examined the man.

“Sorry,” said the doctor, “You’re outside my specialty now. You should see a gastrologist! \[gas-TROL′-Ə-jist—a stomach specialist].”

The gastrologist X-rayed the patient. “Sorry,” said the doctor, “the tooth has traveled into your lower intestines. You should see an enterologist! \[en′-tƏ-ROL′-Ə-jist—an intestinal specialist].”

The enterologist took some X rays. “Sorry, the tooth isn’t there. It must have gone down farther. You should see a proctologist! \[prok-TOL′-Ə-jist—a specialist in diseases of the rectum; from Greek _proktos_, anus].”

Our patient is now on the proctologist’s examining table, in the proper elbow-knee position. The doctor has inserted a proctoscope and is looking through it.

“Good heavens, man! You’ve got a tooth up there! You should see a dentist!”

5\. _Aural_ (AWR-Əl) refers to the ears or to the sense or phenomenon of hearing. _Monaural_ reproduction, as of music over a radio or by a phonograph record, for example, has only one source of sound, and technically should be called _monophonic_ (mon′-Ə-FON′-ik)—_monos_, one, plus _phone_, sound. _Binaural_ may mean _having two ears_ or _involving the use of both ears_, or, recently, _descriptive of sound from two sources_, giving a _stereophonic_ (steer′-ee-Ə-FON′-ik) effect—_stereos_, deep, solid, plus _phone._

6\. A _noctambulist_ (nok-TAM′-byƏ-list) walks at night—_nox, noctis_, night, plus _ambulo_, to walk. Noun: _noctambulism_ (nok-TAM′-byƏ-liz-Əm).

7\. _Somnific_ (som-NIF′-ik): _a somnific_ lecture, movie, effect, etc.

8\. _Circumambulate_ (sur′-kƏm-AM′-byƏ-layt′). To _circumnavigate_ is to sail around—_circum_, around, plus _navis_, ship.

#### CHAPTER 11:

1\. _Matronymic_ (mat′-rƏ-NIM′-ik). Or, if you prefer to use the Greek root for mother (_meter, metr_-), _metronymic._ The Greek word _metra_, uterus, derives from _meter_, naturally enough, so _metritis_ is inflammation of the uterus; _metralgia_ is uterine pain; _endometriosis_ (en′-dō-mee′-tree-Ō′-sis) is any abnormal conditionof the uterine lining—_endo_, inside; _metra_, uterus; -_osis_, abnormal condition.

2\. (a) An _incendiary_ statement, remark, speech, etc. figuratively enflames an audience, sets them afire, gets them excited, galvanizes them into action, etc.

&#x20;   (b) _Incense_ (IN′-sens) is a substance that sends off a pleasant odor when burned—often, but not necessarily, to mask unpleasant or telltale smells, as of marijuana smoke, etc.

&#x20;   (c) To _incense_ (in-SENS′) is to anger greatly, i.e., to “burn up.” “I’m all burned up” is etymologically an accurate translation of “I’m _incensed._”

3\. (a) _Ardent_ (AHR′-dƏnt)—burning with zeal, ambition, love, etc., as an _ardent_ suitor, worker, etc.

&#x20;   (b) _Ardor_ (AHR′-dƏr)—the noun form of _ardent_—burning passion, zeal, enthusiasm, etc. Alternate noun: _ardency_ (AHR′-dƏn-see).

4\. _Megaphone._

5\. _Megalopolis_ (meg′-Ə-LOP′-Ə-lis).

6\. _Police. Politics._

7\. _Bibliokleptomaniac_ (bib′-lee-ō-klep′-tƏ-MAY′-nee-ak): one who has an obsession for stealing books. Not too many years ago, an author titled his book, _Steal This Book!_, perhaps hoping to appeal to _bibliokleptomaniacs;_ if the appeal was successful enough, his royalty statements must have been minuscule indeed!

_Gynekleptomaniac._

_Pedokleptomaniac._

_Androkleptomaniac._

_Demokleptomaniac._

If you prefer to use shorter words, _compulsive kidnapper_ or _obsessive abductor_ will do as well for these words.

8\. _Acromaniac._\
&#x20;       _Agoramaniac._\
&#x20;       _Claustromaniac._

9\. _Kleptophobe; pyrophobe; gynephobe; androphobe; demophobe._

_Triskaidekaphobia_ (tris′-kī-dek′-Ə-FŌ′-bee-Ə) is the morbiddread of the number 13, from Greek _triskai_, three, _deka_, ten, and _phobia._

10\. _Gnosiology_ (nō′-see-OL′-Ə-jee), the science or study of knowledge.

11\. _Amadeus_ is love (Latin _amor_) God (Latin _deus_). _Theophilus_ is love (Greek _philos_) God (Greek _theos_). _Gottlieb_ is love (German _Lieb_) God (German _Gott_).

Perhaps this explains why he started composing at the age of four and wrote forty-one symphonies.

12\. _Cellophane_—cellulose made to be transparent, i.e., to _show_ what’s wrapped in it.

13\. _Hypoglycemia_ (hī-pō-glī-SEE′-mee-Ə)—low blood sugar, a common ailment today, though I believe the AMA has called it a “non-disease” (Greek _hypos_, under; _glykys_, sweet; _haima_, blood).

_Haima_, blood, is found in many English words, the root spelled either _hem_- or -_em._ Here are a few, with their etymological interpretations:

&#x20;     (a) _Hemorrhage_—excessive blood flow.

&#x20;     (b) _Anemia_—“no blood”—actually a pathological reduction of red blood corpuscles.

&#x20;     (c) _Hematology_—science of blood (and its diseases).

&#x20;     (d) _Hemophilia_—“love of blood”—actually a hereditary condition, occurring in males, in which the blood clots too slowly.

&#x20;     (e) _Hemoglobin_—“blood gobules”—actually the red coloring matter of the red blood corpuscles.

_Hyperglycemia_ is the opposite of _hypoglycemia._

14\. (a) _Pantheon_ (PAN′-thee-on′)—a temple built in Rome in 27 B.C. for “all the gods.”

&#x20;     (b) _Pandemonium_ (pan′-dƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əm)—a word supposedly coined by poet John Milton in _Paradise Lost_ to signify the dwelling place of all the demons; now any wild and noisy disorder.

&#x20;     (c) _Panorama_ (pan′-Ə-RAM′-Ə _or_ pan′-Ə-RAH′-mƏ)—a view (or a picture of such a view) all around—_pan_, all, plus _horama_, view. The adjective: _panoramic_ (pan′-Ə-RAM′-ik).

15\. _Monarchy_—rule by one person.

1\. _Non sequitur_ (non SEK′-wƏ-tƏr)—“it does not follow.”

2\. (a) _Second_—following after the first.

&#x20;   (b) _Consecutive_—following in proper order

&#x20;   (c) _Persecute_—to follow (i.e., pursue) through and through; hence to annoy, harass continually for no good reason.

&#x20;   (d) _Prosecute_—to follow before; hence to pursue (something) diligently or vigorously in order to complete it successfully (_prosecute_ a campaign); or to start, or engage in, legal proceedings against, especially in an official capacity.

&#x20;   (d) _Supernatural._

&#x20;   (e) _Supervise._

4\. (a) _Cadence_ (KAY′-dƏns)—fall and rise of the voice in speaking; hence inflection, rhythm beat, etc. of sound or music. Adjective: _cadent_ (KAY′-dƏnt).

&#x20;   (b) _Occidental_ (ok′-sƏ-DEN′-tƏl)—etymologically, falling. Hence relating to western countries, since the sun falls in the west; also, a native of such a country. Noun: _Occident_ (OK′-sƏ-dƏnt). The sun rises in the east, so Latin _orior_, to rise, is the origin of the _Orient, oriental_, etc., and also of the verb _orient_ (AW′-ree-ent′). To _orient_ is to adjust to a place or situation; etymologically, to turn, or face, east. Noun: _orientation._ “I’m finally _oriented_” does not mean that I’m easternized or facing east, but that I have become familiar with, and comfortable in, a place, job, situation, etc. So to _disorient_ (dis-AW′-ree-ent′) is to remove (someone’s) _orientation_, or to confuse or bewilder, especially in reference to locality, direction, etc. Noun: _disorientation._

&#x20;   (c)_Deciduous_ (dƏ-SIJ′-![](blob:moz-extension://95c76d74-e490-4d6a-85ca-b2d3597fcaba/03d7af95-3d05-4eca-b6d9-df66f8838f0c)-Əs)—falling down (Latin prefix _de_-). This adjective refers to trees whose leaves fall (down) every autumn.

&#x20;   (d) _Incident_—that which falls upon, befalls, or happens.

&#x20;   (e) _Accident_—that which falls to (_ac_- is a respelling of _ad_-, to, toward) someone or something (by chance).

&#x20;   (f) _Coincidence—co_- is a respelling of _con_-, together. A _coincidence_ occurs when two things befall, or happen, together, or at the same time, and by chance.

5\. _Indolent_ (IN′-dƏ-lƏnt). Noun: _indolence_ (IN′-dƏ-lƏns).

6\. _Dolores_—from Spanish _Maria de los Dolores_, Mary of the Sorrows; hence, I guess, someone who is generally sorrowful, though the few Doloreses I have known do not live up to their etymology.
