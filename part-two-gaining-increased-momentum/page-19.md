## HOW TO SPEAK NATURALLY

Consider this statement by Louis Bromfield, a noted author: “If I, as a novelist, wrote dialogue for my characters which was meticulously grammatical, the result would be the creation of a speech which rendered the characters pompous and unreal.”

And this one by Jacques Barzun, former literary critic for _Harper’s:_ “Speech, after all, is in some measure an expression of character, and flexibility in its use is a good way to tell your friends from the robots.”

Consider also this puckish remark by the late Clarence Darrow: “Even if you do learn to speak correct English, who are you going to speak it to?”

These are typical reactions of professional people to the old restrictions of formal English grammar. Do the actual teachers of English feel the same way? Again, some typical statements:

“Experts and authorities do not make decisions and rules, by logic or otherwise, about correctness,” said E. A. Cross, then Professor of English at the Greeley, Colorado, College of Education. “All they can do is observe the customs of cultivated and educated people and report their findings.”

“Grammar is only an analysis after the facts, a post-mortem on usage,” said Stephen Leacock in _How To Write._ “Usage comes first and usage must rule.”

One way to discover current trends in usage is to poll a crosssection of people who use the language professionally, inquiring as to their opinion of the acceptability, in everyday speech, of certain specific and controversial expressions. A questionnaire I prepared recently was answered by eighty-two such people—thirty-one authors, seven book reviewers, thirty-three editors, and eleven professors of English. The results, some of which will be detailed below, may possibly prove startling to you if you have been conditioned to believe, as most of us have, that correct English is rigid, unchangeable, and exclusively dependent on grammatical rules.

RIGHT      WRONG

1\. Californians boast of the _healthy_ climate of their state.

RIGHT. There is a distinction, says formal grammar, between _healthy_ and _healthful._ A person can be _healthy_—I am still quoting the rule—if he possesses good health. But climate must be _healthful_, since it is _conducive_ to health. This distinction is sometimes observed in writing but rarely in everyday speech, as you have probably noticed. Even the dictionaries have stopped splitting hairs—they permit you to say _healthy_ no matter which of the two meanings you intend.

“_Healthy_ climate” was accepted as current educated usage by twenty-six of the thirty-three editors who answered the questionnaire,six of the seven book reviewers, nine of the eleven professors of English, and twenty of the thirty-one authors. The earlier distinction, in short, is rapidly becoming obsolete.

2\. Her new novel is not _as_ good as her first one.

RIGHT. If you have studied formal grammar, you will recall that after a negative verb the “proper” word is _so_, not _as._ Is this rule observed by educated speakers? Hardly ever.

In reference to the sentence under discussion, author Thomas W. Duncan remarked: “I always say—and write—_as_, much to the distress of my publisher’s copyreader. But the fellow is a wretched purist.”

The tally on this use of _as_ showed seventy-four for, only eight against.

3\. We _can’t_ hardly believe it.

WRONG. Of the eighty-two professional people who answered my questionnaire, seventy-six rejected this sentence; it is evident that _can’t hardly_ is far from acceptable in educated speech. Preferred usage: We _can_ hardly believe it.

4\. This is _her._

WRONG. This substitution of _her_ where the rule requires _she_ was rejected by fifty-seven of my eighty-two respondents. Paradoxically enough, although “It’s _me_” and “This is _me_” are fully established in educated speech, “This is _her_” still seems to be condemned by the majority of cultivated speakers. Nevertheless, the average person, I imagine, may feel a bit uncomfortable saying “This is _she_”—it sounds almost too sophisticated.

This is more than an academic problem. If the voice at the other end of a telephone conversation makes the opening move with “I’d like to speak to Jane Doe \[your name, for argument’s sake],” you are, unfortunately, on the horns of a very real dilemma. “This is _she_” may sound prissy—“This is _her_” may give the impression that you’re uneducated. Other choices are equally doubtful. “Talking!” is suspiciously businesslike if the call comes to your home, and “I am Jane Doe!” may make you feel like the opening line of a high school tableau. The need for a decision arises several times in a busy day—and, I am sorry to report, the English language is just deficient enough not to be of much help. I wonder how it would be if you just grunted affably?

5\. _Who_ are you waiting for?

RIGHT. _Formal grammar_ not only requires _whom_ but demands that the word order be changed to: “For whom are you waiting?” (Just try talking with such formality on everyday occasions and see how long you’ll keep your friends.)

_Who_ is the normal, popular form as the first word of a sentence, no matter what the grammatical construction; and an opinion by Kyle Crichton, a well-known magazine editor, is typical of the way many educated people feel. Mr. Crichton says: “The most loathsome word (to me at least) in the English language is _whom._ You can always tell a half-educated buffoon by the care he takes in working the word in. When he starts it, I know I am faced with a pompous illiterate who is not going to have me long as company.”

The score for acceptance of the sentence as it stands (with _who_) was sixty-six out of eighty-two. If, like most unpedantic speakers, you prefer _who_ to _whom_ for informal occasions, or if you feel as strongly about _whom_ as Mr. Crichton does, you will be happy to hear that modern trends in English are all on your side.

6\. Please take care of _whomever_ is waiting.

WRONG. _Whomever_ is awkward and a little silly in this sentence and brings to mind Franklin P. Adams’ famous remark on grammar: “ ‘Whom are you?’ asked Cyril, for he had been to night school.” It is also contrary to grammatical rule. People who are willing to be sufficiently insufferable to use _whomever_ in this construction have been tempted into error by the adjacent word _of._ They believe that since they are following a preposition with an objective pronoun they are speaking impeccable grammar. In actuality, however, _whomever_ is not the object of the preposition _of_ but the subject of the verb _is waiting._ Preferable form: Please take care of _whoever_ is waiting.

7\. _Whom_ would you like to be if you weren’t yourself?

WRONG. Here is another and typical example of the damage which an excessive reverence for _whom_ can do to an innocent person’s speech. Judged by grammatical rule, _whom_ is incorrect in this sentence (the verb _to be_ requires _who_); judged by normal speech patterns, it is absurd. This use of _whom_ probably comes from an abortive attempt to sound elegant.

8\. My wife has been _robbed._

RIGHT—if something your wife owns was taken by means of thievery. However, if your wife herself was kidnapped, or in some way talked into leaving you, she was _stolen_, not _robbed._ To _rob_ is to abscond with the contents of something—to _steal_ is to walk off with the thing itself. Needless to say, both forms of activity are highly antisocial and equally illegal.

9\. Is this _desert_ fattening?

WRONG. The _dessert_ that is fattening is spelled with two _s_’s. With one _s_, it’s a desert, like the Sahara. Remember the two _s_’s in dessert by thinking how much you’d like _two_ portions, if only your waistline permitted.
