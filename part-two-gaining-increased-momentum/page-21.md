## DO YOU ALWAYS USE THE PROPER WORD?

The fact is that grammar is getting more liberal every day. Common usage has put a stamp of approval on many expressions which your grandmother would not have dared utter in her most intimate conversation—not if she believed she was in the habit of using good English. _It is me; have you got a cold?; it’s a nice day; can I have another piece of cake?; she is a most aggravating child; will everybody please remove their hats_—all these today represent perfectly correct grammar for everyday conversation. Modern grammar research reports that these expressions have become universal in educated speech.

However, such a liberal policy does not mean that all bars are down. Only a person whose speech borders on the illiterate would make such statements as: _can you learn me to swim?; he don’t live here no more; we ain’t working so good; me and my husband are glad to see you._ There are still certain minimum essentials of good English that the cultivated speaker carefully observes.

Is your grammar as good as the next person’s? Here’s a quick test by which you can measure your ability.

Check the preferable choice in each sentence, then compare your results with the key at the end. Allowing 4 per cent for each correct answer, consider 92–100 excellent, 76–88 good, 68–72 average.
