### SESSION 28 <a href="#page283" id="page283"></a>

There are few of us who do not need warm and nourishing relationships to lead a fulfilled life.

Psychology makes clear that loving and being loved are important elements in emotional health, but also points out the necessity for expressing, rather than repressing, our hostilities. (You know how good you feel once you blow off steam? And how much closer you can become attached to someone once you directly and honestly vent your anger, resentment, or irritation instead of bottling it up and seething in fury?)

It is a mark of your own emotional maturity if you can _accept_ hostility as well as dish it out. So let us pretend, in order to encourage you to become personally involved in the introductory ten words of this chapter, that each paragraph in the next few pages accurately describes _you._ What label exactly fits your personality?

#### IDEAS

**1. slave driver**

You make everyone toe the mark—right down to the last centimeter. You exact blind, unquestioning obedience; demand the strictest conformity to rules, however arbitrary or tyrannical; and will not tolerate the slightest deviation from your orders. You are, in short, the very epitome of the army drill sergeant.

You are a _martinet._

**2. bootlicker**

You toady to rich or influential people, catering to their vanity, flattering their ego. You are the personification of the traditionalward heeler, you out-yes the Hollywood yes men. And on top of all these unpleasant characteristics, you’re a complete hypocrite. All your servile attentions and unceasing adulation spring from your own selfish desires to get ahead, not out of any sincere admiration. You cultivate people of power or property so that you can curry favor at the opportune moment.

You are a _sycophant._

**3. dabbler**

Often, though not necessarily, a person of independent income, you engage superficially in the pursuit of one of the fine arts—painting, writing, sculpturing, composing, etc. You do this largely for your own amusement and not to achieve any professional competence; nor are you at all interested in monetary rewards. Your artistic efforts are simply a means of passing time pleasantly.

You are a _dilettante._

**4. battle-ax**

You are a loud-mouthed, shrewish, turbulent woman; you’re quarrelsome and aggressive, possessing none of those gentle and tender qualities stereotypically associated with femininity. You’re strong-minded, unyielding, sharp-tongued, and dangerous. You can curse like a stevedore and yell like a fishwife—and often do.

You are a _virago._

**5. superpatriot**

Anything you own or belong to is better—simply because you own it or belong to it, although you will be quick to find more justifiable explanations. Your religion, whatever it may be, is far superior to any other; your political party is the only honest one; your neighborhood puts all others in the city in the shade; members of your own sex are more intelligent, more worthy, more emotionally secure, and in every way far better than people of the opposite sex; your car is faster, more fun to drive, and gets better gas mileage than any other, no matter in what price range; and ofcourse your country and its customs leave nothing to be desired, and inhabitants of other nations are in comparison barely civilized. In short, you are exaggeratedly, aggressively, absurdly, and excessively devoted to your own affiliations—and you make no bones about advertising such prejudice.

You are a _chauvinist._

**6. fanatic**

You have a one-track mind—and when you’re riding a particular hobby, you ride it hard. You have such an excessive, all-inclusive zeal for one thing (and it may be your business, your profession, your husband or wife, your children, your stomach, your money, or whatever) that your obsession is almost absurd. You talk, eat, sleep that one thing—to the point where you bore everyone to distraction.

You are a _monomaniac._

**7. attacker**

You are violently against established beliefs, revered traditions, cherished customs—such, you say, stand in the way of reform and progress and are always based on superstition and irrationality. Religion, family, marriage, ethics—you weren’t there when these were started and you’re not going to conform simply because most unthinking people do.

You are an _iconoclast._

**8. skeptic**

There is no God—that’s your position and you’re not going to budge from it.

You are _an atheist._

**9. self-indulger**

You are, as a male, lascivious, libidinous, lustful, lewd, wanton, immoral—but more important, you promiscuously attempt to satisfy(and are often successful in so doing) your sexual desires with any woman within your arm’s reach.

You are a _lecher._

**10. worrier**

You are always sick, though no doctor can find an organic cause for your ailments. You know you have ulcers, though medical tests show a healthy stomach. You have heart palpitations, but a cardiogram fails to show any abnormality. Your headaches are caused (you’re sure of it) by a rapidly growing brain tumor—yet X rays show nothing wrong. These maladies are not imaginary, however; to you they are most real, non-existent as they may be in fact. And as you travel from doctor to doctor futilely seeking confirmation of your imminent death, you become more and more convinced that you’re too weak to go on much longer. Organically, of course, there’s nothing the matter with you. Perhaps tensions, insecurities, or a need for attention is taking the form of simulated bodily ills.

You are a _hypochondriac._

### SESSION 29

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. the French drillmaster**

Jean Martinet was the Inspector General of Infantry during the reign of King Louis XIV—and a stricter, more fanatic drillmaster France had never seen. It was from this time that the French Army’s reputation for discipline dated, and it is from the name of this Frenchman that we derive our English word _martinet._ The word is always used in a derogatory sense and generally shows resentmentand anger on the part of the user. The secretary who calls his boss a _martinet_, the wife who applies the epithet to her husband, the worker who thus refers to the foreman—these speakers all show their contempt for the excessive, inhuman discipline to which they are asked to submit.

Since _martinet_ comes from a man’s name (in the Brief Intermission which follows we shall discover that a number of picturesque English words are similarly derived), there are no related forms built on the same root. There is an adjective _martinetish_ (mahr-tƏ-NET′-ish) and another noun form, _martinetism_, but these are used only rarely.

**2. a Greek “fig-shower”**

_Sycophant_ comes to us from the Greeks. According to Shipley’s Dictionary of Word Origins:

When a fellow wants to get a good mark, he may polish up an apple and place it on teacher’s desk; his classmates call such a lad an apple-shiner. Less complimentary localities use the term bootlicker. The Greeks had a name for it: _fig-shower._ Sycophant is from Gr. _sykon_, fig, \[and] _phanein_, to show. This was the fellow that informed the officers in charge when (1) the figs in the sacred groves were being taken, or (2) when the Smyrna fig-dealers were dodging the tariff.

Thus, a _sycophant_ may appear to be a sort of “stool pigeon,” since the latter curries the favor of police officials by “peaching” on his fellow criminals. _Sycophants_ may use this means of ingratiating themselves with influential citizens of the community; or they may use flattery, servile attentions, or any other form of insinuating themselves into someone’s good graces. A _sycophant_ practices _sycophancy_ (SIK′-Ə-fƏn-see), and has a _sycophantic_ (sik-Ə-FAN′-tik) attitude. All three forms of the word are highly uncomplimentary—use them with care.

Material may be so delicate or fine in texture that anything behind it will show through. The Greek prefix _dia_- means _through;_ and _phanein_, as you now know, means _to show_—hence such material is called _diaphanous_ (dī-AF′-Ə-nƏs). Do not use the adjective in reference to all material that is transparent (for example,you would not call glass _diaphanous_, even though you can see right through it), but only material that is silky, gauzy, filmy, and, in addition, transparent or practically transparent. The word is often applied to female garments—nightgowns, negligees, etc.

**3. just for one’s own amusement**

_Dilettante_ is from the Italian verb _dilettare_, to delight. The _dilettante_ paints, writes, composes, plays a musical instrument, or engages in scientific experiments purely for amusement—not to make money, become famous, or satisfy a deep creative urge (the latter, I presume, being the justifications for the time that professional artists, writers, composers, musicians, poets, and scientists spend at their chosen work). A _dilettantish_ (dil-Ə-TAN′-tish) attitude is superficial, unprofessional; _dilettantism_ (dil-Ə-TAN′-tiz-Əm) is superficial, part-time dabbling in the type of activity that usually engages the full time and energy of the professional artist or scientist.

Do not confuse the _dilettante_, who has a certain amount of native talent or ability, with the _tyro_ (TĪ′-rō), who is the inexperienced beginner in some art, but who may be full of ambition, drive, and energy. To call a person a _tyro_ is to imply that he is just starting in some artistic, scientific, or professional field—he’s not much good yet because he has not had time to develop his skill, if any. The _dilettante_ usually has some skill but isn’t doing much with it. On the other hand, anyone who has developed consummate skill in an artistic field, generally allied to music, is called a _virtuoso_ (vur′-ch-Ō′-sō)—like Heifetz or Menuhin on the violin, Horowitz or Rubinstein on the piano. Pluralize _virtuoso_ in the normal way—_virtuosos;_ or if you wish to sound more sophisticated, give it the continental form—_virtuosi_ (vur′-ch-Ō′-see). Similarly, the plural of _dilettante_ is either _dilettantes_ or _dilettanti_ (dil-Ə-TAN′-tee).

The _i_ ending for a plural is the Italian form and is common in musical circles. For example, _libretto_, the story (or book) of an opera, may be pluralized to _libretti; concerto_, a form of musical composition, is pluralized _concerti._ However, the Anglicized _librettos_ and _concertos_ are perfectly correct also. _Libretto_ is pronounced lƏ-BRET′-ō; _libretti_ is lƏ-BRET′-ee; _concerto_ is kƏn-CHUR′-tō;and _concerti_ is kƏn-CHUR′-tee. Suit your plural form, I would suggest, to the sophistication of your audience.

**4. “masculine” women**

_Virago_ comes, oddly enough, from the Latin word for man, _vir._ Perhaps the derivation is not so odd after all; a _virago_, far from being stereotypically feminine (i.e., timid, delicate, low-spoken, etc.), is stereotypically masculine in personality—coarse, aggressive, loud-mouthed. _Termagant_ (TUR′-mƏ-gƏnt) and _harridan_ (HAIR′-Ə-dƏn) are words with essentially the same uncomplimentary meaning as _virago._ To call a brawling woman a _virago_, a _termagant_, and a _harridan_ is admittedly repetitious, but is successful in relieving one’s feelings.

**5. the old man**

Nicolas Chauvin, soldier of the French Empire, so vociferously and unceasingly aired his veneration of Napoleon Bonaparte that he became the laughingstock of all Europe. Thereafter, an exaggerated and blatant patriot was known as a _chauvinist_—and still is today. _Chauvinism_ (SHŌ′-vƏ-niz-Əm), by natural extension, applies to blatant veneration of, or boastfulness about, any other affiliation besides one’s country.

To be _patriotic_ is to be normally proud of, and devoted to, one’s country—to be _chauvinistic_ (shō′-vƏ-NIS′-tik) is to exaggerate such pride and devotion to an obnoxious degree.

We might digress here to investigate an etymological side road down which the word _patriotic_ beckons. _Patriotic_ is built on the Latin word _pater, patris_, father—one’s country is, in a sense, one’s fatherland.

Let us see what other interesting words are built on this same root.

1\. _patrimony_ (PAT′-rƏ-mō-nee)—an inheritance from one’s father. The -_mony_ comes from the same root that gives us _money_, namely _Juno Moneta_, the Roman goddess who guarded the temples of finance. The adjective is _patrimonial_ (pat′-rƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əl).

2._patronymic_ (pat′-rƏ-NIM′-ik)—a name formed on the father’s name, like _Johnson_ (son of John), _Martinson, Aaronson_, etc. The word combines _pater, patris_ with Greek _onyma_, name. _Onyma_ plus the Greek prefix _syn_-, with or together, forms _synonym_ (SIN′-Ə-nim), a word of the same name (or meaning), etymologically “a together name.” _Onyma_ plus the prefix _anti_- against, forms _antonym_ (AN′-tƏ-nim), a word of opposite meaning, etymologically “an against name.” _Onyma_ plus Greek _homos_, the same, forms _homonym_ (HOM′-Ə-nim), a word that sounds like another but has a different meaning and spelling, like _bare—bear, way—weigh, to—too—two_, etc., etymologically “a same name.” A _homonym_ is more accurately called a _homophone_ (HOM′-Ə-fōn′), a combination of _homos_, the same, and _phone_, sound. The adjective form of _synonym_ is _synonymous_ (sƏ-NON′-Ə-mƏs). Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective derived from:

antonym? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

homonym? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

homophone? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3\. _paternity_ (pƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—fatherhood, as to question someone’s _paternity_, to file a _paternity_ suit in order to collect child support from the assumed, accused, or self-acknowledged father. The adjective is _paternal_ (pƏ-TUR′-nƏl), fatherly. _Paternalism_ (pƏ-TUR′-nƏ-liz-Əm) is the philosophy or system of governing a country, or of managing a business or institution, so that the citizens, employees, or staff are treated in a manner suggesting a father-children relationship. (Such a system sounds, and often is, benign and protective, but plays havoc with the initiative, independence, and creativity of those in subordinate roles.) The adjective is _paternalistic_ (pƏ-turn′-Ə-LIS′-tik).

4\. _patriarch_ (PAY′-tree-ark′)—a venerable, fatherlike old man; an old man in a ruling, fatherlike position. Here _pater, patris_ is combined with the Greek root _archein_, to rule. The adjective is _patriarchal_ (pay′-tree-AHR′-kƏl), the system is a _patriarchy_ (PAY′-tree-ahr′-kee).

5\. _patricide_ (PAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s father. _Pater, patris_ combines with -_cide_, a suffix derived from the Latin verb _caedo_, to kill. The adjective is _patricidal_ (pat-rƏ-SĪ′-dƏl).

This list does not exhaust the number of words built on _pater_, father, but is sufficient to give you an idea of how closely related many English words are. In your reading you will come across other words containing the letters _pater_ or _patr_—you will be able to figure them out once you realize that the base is the word _father._ You might, if you feel ambitious, puzzle out the relationship to the “father idea” in the following words, checking with a dictionary to see how good your linguistic intuition is:

1\. patrician

2\. patron

3\. patronize

4\. patronizing (_adj._)

5\. paterfamilias

6\. padre

**6. the old lady**

_Pater, patris_ is _father. Mater, matris_ is _mother._

For example:

1\. _matriarch_ (MAY′-tree-ahrk′)—the mother-ruler; the “mother person” that controls a large household, tribe, or country. This word, like _patriarch_, is built on the root _archein_, to rule. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth or Queen Victoria, England was a _matriarchy_ (MAY′-tree-ahr′-kee). Can you figure out the adjective form? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. _maternity_ (mƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—motherhood

3\. _maternal_ (mƏ-TURN′-Əl)—motherly

4\. _matron_ (MAY′-trƏn)—an older woman, one sufficiently mature to be a mother. The adjective _matronly_ (MAY′-trƏn-lee) conjures up for many people a picture of a woman no longer in the glow of youth and possibly with a bit of added weight in the wrong places, so this word should be used with caution; it may be hazardous to your health if the lady you are so describing is of a tempestous nature, or is a _virago._

5\. _alma mater_ (AL′-mƏ MAY′-tƏr _or_ AHL′-mƏ MAH′-tƏr)—etymologically, “soul mother”; actually, the school or college from which one has graduated, and which in a sense is one’s intellectual mother.

6._matrimony_ (MAT′-rƏ-mō′-nee)—marriage. Though this word is similar to _patrimony_ in spelling, it does not refer to _money_, as _patrimony_ does; unless, that is, you are cynical enough to believe that people marry for money. As the language was growing, marriage and children went hand in hand—it is therefore not surprising that the word for _marriage_ should be built on the Latin root for _mother._ Of course, times have changed, but the sexist nature of the English language has not. The noun suffix -_mony_ indicates state, condition, or result, as in _sanctimony, parsimony_, etc. The adjective is _matrimonial_ (mat′-rƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əl).

7\. _matricide_ (MAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s mother. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**7. murder most foul…**

Murder unfortunately is an integral part of human life, so there is a word for almost every kind of killing you can think of. Let’s look at some of them.

1\. _suicide_ (S′-Ə-sīd′)—killing oneself (intentionally); -_cide_ plus _sui_, of oneself. This is both the act and the person who has been completely successful in performing the act (_partially_ doesn’t count); also, in colloquial usage, _suicide_ is a verb. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. _fratricide_ (FRAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s brother; -_cide_ plus _frater, fratris_, brother. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. _sororicide_ (sƏ-RAWR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s sister; -_cide_ plus _soror_, sister. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. _homicide_ (HOM′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of a human being; -_cide_ plus _homo_, person. In law, _homicide_ is the general term for any slaying. If intent and premeditation can be proved, the act is _murder_ and punishable as such. If no such intent is present, the act is called _manslaughter_ and receives a lighter punishment. Thus, if your mate/lover/spouse makes your life unbearable and you slip some arsenic into his/her coffee one bright morning, you are committing murder—that is, if he/she succumbs. On the other hand, if you run your victim down—quite accidentally—withyour car, bicycle, or wheelchair, with no intent to kill, you will be accused of _manslaughter_—that is, if death results and if you can prove you didn’t really mean it. It’s all rather delicate, however, and you might do best to put thoughts of justifiable _homicide_ out of your mind. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

5\. _regicide_ (REJ′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s king, president, or other governing official. Booth committed _regicide_ when he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Derivation: Latin _rex, regis_, king, plus -_cide._

6\. _uxoricide_ (uk-SAWR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s wife. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Derivation: Latin _uxor_, wife, plus -_cide._

7\. _mariticide_ (mƏ-RIT′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s husband. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Derivation: Latin _maritus_, husband, plus -_cide._

8\. _infanticide_ (in-FAN′-tƏ-sīd′)—the killing of a newborn child. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Derivation: Latin _infans, infantis_, baby, plus -_cide._

9\. _genocide_ (JEN′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of a whole race or nation. This is a comparatively new word, coined in 1944 by a UN official named Raphael Lemkin, to refer to the mass murder of the Jews, Poles, etc. ordered by Hitler. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Derivation: Greek _genos_, race, kind, plus -_cide._

10\. _parricide_ (PAIR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of either or both parents. Adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Lizzie Borden was accused of, and tried for, _parricide_ in the 1890s, but was not convicted. A bit of doggerel that was popular at the time, and, so I have been told, little girls jumped rope to, went somewhat as follows:

Lizzie Borden took an ax

And gave her mother forty whacks—

And when she saw what she had done,

She gave her father forty-one.

### SESSION 30

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. brothers and sisters, wives and husbands**

_Frater_, brother; _soror_, sister; _uxor_, wife; and _maritus_, husband—these roots are the source of a number of additional English words:

1\. to _fraternize_ (FRAT′-Ər-nīz′)—etymologically, to have a brotherly relationship (with). This verb may be used to indicate social intercourse between people, irrespective of sex, as in, “Members of the faculty often _fraternized_ after school hours.”

Additionally, and perhaps more commonly, there may be the implication of having a social relationship with one’s subordinates in an organization, or even with one’s so-called inferiors, as in, “The president of the college was reluctant to _fraternize_ with faculty members, preferring to keep all her contacts with them on an exclusively professional basis”; or as in, “The artist enjoyed _fraternizing_ with thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, and pimps, partly out of social perversity, partly to find interesting faces to put in his paintings.”

The verb also gained a new meaning during and after World War II, when soldiers of occupying armies had sexual relations with the women of conquered countries, as in, “Military personnel were strictly forbidden to _fraternize_ with the enemy.” (How euphemistic can you get?)

Can you write the noun form of _fraternize?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. _fraternal_ (frƏ-TUR′-nƏl)—brotherly. The word also designates _non-identical_ (twins).

3\. _fraternity_ (frƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—a men’s organization in a high school or college, often labeled with Greek letters (the Gamma Delta Epsilon _Fraternity_); or any group of people of similar interests or profession (the medical _fraternity_, the financial _fraternity_).

4\. _sorority_ (sƏ-RAWR′-Ə-tee)—a women’s organization in high school or college, again usually Greek-lettered; or any women’s social club.

5\. _uxorious_ (uk-SAWR′-ee-Əs)—an adjective describing a man who excessively, even absurdly, caters to, dotes on, worships, and submits to the most outlandish or outrageous demands of, his wife. This word is _not_ synonymous with _henpecked_, as the henpecked husband is dominated by his wife, perhaps because of his own fear or weakness, while the _uxorious_ husband is dominated only by his neurosis, and quite likely the wife finds his _uxoriousness_ (uk-SAWR′-ee-Əs-nƏs) comical or a pain in the neck. (There can, indeed, be too much of a good thing!)

6\. _uxorial_—pertaining to, characteristic of, or befitting, a wife, as _uxorial_ duties, privileges, attitudes, etc.

7\. _marital_ (MAIR′-Ə-tƏl)—etymologically, pertaining or referring to, or characteristic of, a husband; but the meaning has changed to include the marriage relationship of both husband _and_ wife (don’t ever let anyone tell you that our language is not sexist!), as _marital_ duties, obligations, privileges, arguments, etc. Hence _extramarital_ is literally _outside the marriage_, as in _extramarital_ affairs (hanky-panky with someone other than one’s spouse). And _premarital_ (Latin prefix _pre_-, before) describes events that occur before a planned marriage, as _premarital_ sex, a _premarital_ agreement as to the division of property, etc.

**2. of cabbages and kings (without the cabbage)**

_Rex, regis_ is Latin for _king. Tyrannosaurus rex_ was the king (i.e., the largest) of the dinosaurs (etymologically, “king of the tyrant lizards”). Dogs are often named _Rex_ to fool them into thinking they are kings rather than slaves. And _regal_ (REE′-gƏl) is royal, or fit for a king, hence magnificent, stately, imperious, splendid, etc., as in _regal_ bearing or manner, a _regal_ mansion, a _regal_ reception, etc. The noun is _regality_ (rƏ-GAL′-Ə-tee).

_Regalia_ (rƏ-GAYL′-yƏ), a plural noun, designated the emblems or insignia or dress of a king, and now refers to any impressively formal clothes; or, more commonly, to the decorations, insignia, or uniform of a rank, position, office, social club, etc. “The Shriners were dressed in full _regalia_,” “The five-star general appeared in full _regalia_,” etc.

**3. “madness” of all sorts**

The _monomaniac_ develops an abnormal obsession in respect to _one_ particular thing (Greek _monos_, one), but is otherwise normal. The obsession itself, or the obsessiveness, is _monomania_ (mon′-Ə-MAY′-nee-Ə), the adjective is _monomaniacal_ (mon′-Ə-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl). _Monomaniacal_, like the adjective forms of various other manias, is tricky to pronounce—practice carefully to make sure you can say it correctly without stuttering.

Psychology recognizes other abnormal states, all designating obsessions, and built on Greek _mania_, madness.

1\. _dipsomania_ (dip′-sƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to keep on absorbing alcoholic beverages (Greek _dipsa_, thirst). The _dipsomaniac_ has been defined as the person for whom one drink is too many, a thousand not enough. Recent investigations suggest that _dipsomania_, or alcoholism, may not necessarily be caused by anxieties or frustrations, but possibly by a metabolic or physiological disorder.

Adjective: _dipsomaniacal_ (dip′-sƏ-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl).

2\. _kleptomania_ (klep′-tƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to steal, not from any economic motive, but simply because the urge to take another’s possessions is irresistible. The _kleptomaniac_ (Greek _klepte_, thief) may be wealthy, and yet be an obsessive shoplifter. The _kleptomaniac_, for reasons that psychologists are still arguing about, is more often a female than a male, and may pinch her best friend’s valueless trinket, or a cheap ashtray or salt shaker from a restaurant, not because she wants, let alone needs, the article, but because she apparently can’t help herself; she gets carried away. (When she arrives home, she may toss it in a drawer with other loot, and never look at it again.)

Can you write (and _correctly_ pronounce) the adjective?

3\. _pyromania_ (pī′-rƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to set fires. _Pyromania_ should not be confused with _incendiarism_ (in-SEN′-dee-Ə-riz-Əm), which is the malicious and deliberate burning of another’s property, and is _not_ a compulsive need to see the flames and enjoy the thrill of the heat and the smoke. Some _pyromaniacs_ join volunteer fire companies, often heroically putting out the very blazes they themselves have set. An _incendiary_ (in-SEN′-dee-air-ee) is antisocial, and usually sets fires for revenge. Either of these two dangerous characters is called, colloquially, a “firebug.”

In law, setting fire to another’s, or to one’s own, property for the purpose of economic gain (such as the collection of the proceeds of an insurance policy) is called _arson_ (AHR′-sƏn) and is a felony. The _pyromaniac_ sets fire for the thrill; the _incendiary_ for revenge; the _arsonist_ (AHR′-sƏ-nist) for money.

_Pyromania_ is built on Greek _pyros_, fire; _incendiarism_ on Latin _incendo, incensus_, to set fire; _arson_ on Latin _ardo, arsus_, to burn.

Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of _pyromaniac?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. _megalomania_ (meg′-Ə-lƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid delusions of grandeur, power, importance, godliness, etc. Jokes accusing the heads of governments of _megalomania_ are common. Here’s an old chestnut from the forties:

Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were talking about their dreams.

Churchill: I dreamed last night that God had made me _Prime Minister_ of the whole world.

Roosevelt: I dreamed that God had made me _President_ of the whole world.

Stalin: How could you gentlemen have such dreams? _I_ didn’t dream of offering you those positions!

Hitler, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great have been called _megalomaniacs_—all three certainly had delusions about their invincibility.

Can you write (and pronounce correctly!) the adjective derived from _megalomaniac?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

_Megalomania_ is built on Greek _megas_, great, big, large, plus _mania._

\[Can you think of the word for what someone speaks through to make the _sound_ (phone) of his voice _greater?_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

5\. _nymphomania_ (nim′-fƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid, incessant, uncontrollable, and intense desire, on the part of a female, for sexual intercourse (from Greek _nymphe_, bride, plus _mania_).

The person? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

6\. _satyromania_ (sƏ-teer′-Ə-MAY′-nee-Ə)—the same morbid, incessant, etc. desire on the part of a male (from Greek _satyros_, satyr, plus _mania_).

The person? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

A _satyr_ (SAY′-tƏr) was a mythological Greek god, notorious for lechery. He had horns, pointed ears, and the legs of a goat; the rest of him was in human form. _Satyromania_ is also called _satyriasis_ (sat′-Ə-RĪ′-Ə-sis).

**4. and now phobias**

So much for _maniacs._ There is another side to the coin. Just as personality disorders can cause morbid _attraction_ toward certain things or acts (stealing, fire, power, sex, etc.), so also other emotional ills can cause violent or morbid _repulsions_ to certain conditions, things, or situations. There are people who have irrational and deep-seated dread of cats, dogs, fire, the number thirteen, snakes, thunder or lightning, various colors, and so on almost without end:<sup>1</sup> Such morbid dread or fear is called, in the language of psychology, a _phobia_, and we might pause to investigate the three most common ones. These are:

1\. _claustrophobia_ (klaw′-strƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of being physically hemmed in, of enclosed spaces, of crowds, etc. From Latin _claustrum_, enclosed place, plus Greek _phobia_, morbid fear. The person: _claustrophobe_ (KLAW′-strƏ-fōb′). Adjective: _claustrophobic_ (klaw′-strƏ-FŌ′-bik).

2\. _agoraphobia_ (ag′-Ə-rƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of open space, the reverse of _claustrophobia._ People suffering from _agoraphobia_ prefer to stay shut in their homes as much as possible, and become panic-stricken in such places as open fields, large public buildings, airport terminals, etc. From Greek _agora_, market place, plus _phobia._

The person? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. _acrophobia_ (ak′-rƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of high places. The victims of this fear will not climb ladders or trees, or stand on tops of furniture. They refuse to go onto the roof of a building or look out the window of one of the higher floors. From Greek _akros_, highest, plus _phobia._

The person? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

### SESSION 31 <a href="#page318" id="page318"></a>

#### ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

**1. no reverence**

The _iconoclast_ sneers at convention and tradition, attempts to expose our cherished beliefs, our revered traditions, or our stereotypical thinking as shams and myths. H. L. Mencken was the great _iconoclast_ of the 1920s; Tom Wolfe (_The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby_), of the 1960s.

Adolescence is that confused and rebellious time of life in which _iconoclasm_ (ī-KON′-Ə-klaz′-Əm) is quite normal—indeed the adolescent who is not _iconoclastic_ (ī-kon′-Ə-KLAST′-ik) to some degree might be considered either immature or maladjusted. The words are from _eikon_, a religious image, plus _klaein_, to break. _Iconoclasm_ is not of course restricted to religion.

**2. is there a God?**

_Atheist_ combines the Greek negative prefix _a_- with _theos_, God. Do not confuse _atheism_ (AY′-thee-iz-Əm) with _agnosticism_ (ag-NOS′-tƏ-siz-Əm), the philosophy that claims that God is unknowable, that He may or may not exist, and that human beings can never come to a final conclusion about Him. The _agnostic_ (ag-NOS′-tik) does not deny the existence of a deity, as does the _atheist_, but simply holds that no proof can be adduced one way or the other.

**3. how to know**

_Agnostic_ (which is also an adjective) is built on the Greek root _gnostos_, known, and the negative prefix _a_-. An _agnostic_ claims that all but material phenomena is unknown, and, indeed, unknowable.

A _diagnosis_ (dī-Əg-NŌ′-sis), constructed on the allied Greekroot _gnosis_, knowledge, plus _dia_-, through, is a knowing through examination or testing. A _prognosis_ (prog-NŌ′-sis), on the other hand, is etymologically a knowing beforehand, hence a prediction, generally, but not solely, as to the course of a disease. (The Greek prefix _pro_-, before, plus _gnosis._)

Thus, you may say to a doctor: “What’s the _diagnosis_, Doc?”

“Diabetes.”

Then you say, “And what’s the _prognosis?_”

“If you take insulin and watch your diet, you’ll soon be as good as new.”

The doctor’s _prognosis_, then, is a forecast of the development or trend of a disease. The doctor knows beforehand, from previous similar cases, what to expect.

The verb form of _diagnosis_ is _diagnose_ (dī′-Əg-NŌS′); the verb form of _prognosis_ is _prognosticate_ (prog-NOS′-tƏ-kayt′). To use the verb _prognosticate_ correctly, be sure that your meaning involves the forecasting of developments from a consideration of symptoms or conditions—whether the problem is physical, mental, political, economic, psychological, or what have you.

In school, you doubtless recall taking _diagnostic_ (dī′-Əg-NOS′-tik) tests; these measured not what you were supposed to have learned during the semester, but your general knowledge in a field, so that your teachers would know what remedial steps to take, just as doctors rely on their _diagnosis_ to decide what drugs or treatments to prescribe.

In a reading center, various _diagnostic_ machines and tests are used—these tell the clinician what is wrong with a student’s reading and what measures will probably increase such a student’s reading efficiency.

The medical specialist in _diagnosis_ is a _diagnostician_ (dī′-Əg-nos-TISH′-Ən).

The noun form of the verb _prognosticate_ is _prognostication_ (prog-nos′-tƏ-KAY′-shƏn).

**4. getting back to God**

_Theos_, God, is also found in:

1\. _Monotheism_ (MON′-Ə-thee-iz-Əm)—belief in _one_ God. (_Monos_, one, plus _theos_, God.)

Using _atheism, atheist_, and _atheistic_ as a model, write the word for the person who believes in one God: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. _Polytheism_ (POL′-ee-thee-iz-Əm)—belief in _many_ gods, as in ancient Greece or Rome. (_Polys_, many, plus _theos._)

The person with such a belief? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. _Pantheism_ (PAN′-thee-iz-Əm)—belief that God is not in man’s image, but is a combination of all forces of the universe. (_Pan_, all, plus _theos_,) The person? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The adjective? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. _Theology_ (thee-OL′-Ə-jee)—the study of God and religion. (_Theos_ plus _logos_, science or study.)

The student is a _theologian_ (thee′-Ə-LŌ′-jƏn), the adjective is _theological_ (thee′-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).

**5. of sex and the tongue**

A _lecher_ practices lechery (LECH′-Ər-ee). The derivation is Old French _lechier_, to lick. The adjective _lecherous_ (LECH′-Ə-rƏs) has many close or not-so-close synonyms, most of them also, and significantly, starting with the letter _l_, a sound formed with the tongue, supposedly the seat of sensation.

1\. _libidinous_ (lƏ-BID′-Ə-nƏs)—from _libido_, pleasure.

2\. _lascivious_ (lƏ-SIV′-ee-Əs)—from _lascivia_, wantonness.

3\. lubricious (l-BRISH′-Əs)—from _lubricus_, slippery, the same root found in _lubricate._ The noun is _lubricity_ (l-BRIS′-Ə-tee).

4\. licentious (lī-SEN′-shƏs)—from _licere_, to be permitted, the root from which we get _license_, etymologically, “permission,” and _illicit_, etymologically, “not permitted.”

5\. _lewd_—the previous four words derive from Latin, but this one is from Anglo-Saxon _lewed_, vile.

6\. _lustful_—from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning _pleasure, desire._ Noun: _lust._

_Libidinous, lascivious, lubricious, licentious, lewd, lecherous, lustful_ are seven adjectives that indicate sexual desire and/or activity. The implication of all seven words is more or less derogatory.

Each adjective becomes a noun with the addition of the noun suffix -_ness; lubricity_ and _lust_ are alternate noun forms of two of the adjectives.

**6. of sex and the itch**

_Prurient_ (PR′-ee-Ənt), from Latin _prurio_, to itch, to long for, describes someone who is filled with great sexual curiosity, desire, longing, etc. Can you form the noun? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

_Pruritis_ (prr-Ī′-tis), from the same root, is a medical condition in which the skin is very itchy, but without a rash or eruptions. (Scratch enough, of course, as you will be irresistibly tempted to do, and something like a rash will soon appear.) The adjective is _pruritic_ (prr-IT′-ik).

**7. under and over**

_Hypochondria_ (hī-pƏ-KON′-dree-Ə) is built on two Greek roots: _hypos_, under, and _chondros_, the cartilage of the breastbone. This may sound farfetched until you realize that under the breastbone is the abdomen; the ancient Greeks believed that morbid anxiety about one’s health arose in the abdomen—and no one is more morbidly, unceasingly, and unhappily anxious about health than the _hypochondriac._

_Hypochondriac_ is also an adjective—an alternate and more commonly used adjective form is _hypochondriacal_ (hī′-pƏ-kƏn-DRĪ′-Ə-kƏl).

_Hypos_, under, is a useful root to know. The _hypodermic_ needle penetrates _under_ the skin; a _hypothyroid_ person has an _underworking_ thyroid gland; _hypotension_ is abnormally low blood pressure.

On the other hand, _hyper_ is the Greek root meaning _over._ The _hypercritical_ person is excessively fault-finding; _hyperthyroidism is_ an overworking of the thyroid gland; _hypertension_ is high blood pressure; and you can easily figure out the meanings of _hyperacidity, hyperactive, hypersensitive_, etc.

The adjective forms of _hypotension_ and _hypertension_ are _hypotensive_ and _hypertensive._

#### TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST <a href="#page333" id="page333"></a>

1\. If a _patronymic_ is a name derived from the name of one’s father, can you figure out the word for a name derived from one’s _mother’s_ name? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

#### MAGAZINES THAT WILL HELP YOU

When a pregnant woman takes calcium pills, she must make sure also that her diet is rich in vitamin D, since this vitamin makes the absorption of the calcium possible. In building your vocabulary by learning great quantities of new words, you too must take a certain vitamin, metaphorically speaking, to help you absorb, understand, and remember these words. This vitamin is reading—for it is in books and magazines that you will find the words that we have been discussing in these pages. To learn new words without seeing them applied in the context of your reading is to do only half the job and to run the risk of gradually forgetting the additions to your vocabulary. To combine your vocabulary-building with increased reading is to make assurance doubly sure.

You are now so alert to the words and roots we have discussed that you will find that most of your reading will be full of the new words you have learned—and every time you do see one of the words used in context in a book or magazine, you will understand it more fully and will be taking long steps toward using it yourself.

Among magazines, I would like particularly to recommend the following, which will act both to keep you mentally alert and to set the new words you are learning:

&#x20; 1\. _Harper’s Magazine_

&#x20; 2\. _Atlantic Monthly_

&#x20; 3\. _The New Yorker_

&#x20; 4\. _Time_

&#x20; 5\. _Newsweek_

&#x20; 6\. _Esquire_

7\. _Psychology Today_

&#x20; 8\. _Saturday Review_

&#x20; 9\. _Ms._

10\. _Mother Jones_

11\. _Signs_

12\. _National Geographic_

13\. _Smithsonian_

14\. _Human Nature_

15\. _Scientific American_

16\. _Natural History_

These periodicals are aimed at the alert, verbally sophisticated, educated reader; you will see in them, without fail, most of the words you have been studying in this book—not to mention hosts of other valuable words you will want to add to your vocabulary, many of which you will be able to figure out once you recognize their etymological structure.
