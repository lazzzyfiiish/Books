## TEST YOUR GRAMMAR

How good is your English? Have you ever said _me_ and then wondered if it shouldn’t have been _I_—or vice versa? Do you sometimes get a little confused about _lay_ and _lie_ or _who_ and _whom?_ Perhaps you are often a little less than certain about the distinction between _effect_ and _affect, principal_ and _principle, childish_ and _childlike?_

Here is a series of quick tests that will show you how skillful you are in using the right word in the right place, that will give you a reliable indication of how your language ability compares with the average.
