## TAKE THIS SPELLING TEST

Even in the most painstakingly edited of magazines, a silly little misspelling of a perfectly common word will occasionally appear. How the error eluded the collective and watchful eyes of the editor, the associate editor, the assistant editor, the typesetter, and the proofreader, no one will ever know—for practically every reader of the magazine spots it at once and writes an indignant letter, beginning: “Didn’t you ever go to school …?”

Even if you went to school, you’re going to have plenty of trouble spotting the one misspelled word in each group below. And not one of these words will be a demon like _sphygmomanometer_ (a device for measuring blood pressure) or _piccalilli_ (a highly seasoned relish), which no one would ever dare spell without first checking with a dictionary. On the contrary, every word will be of the common or garden variety that you might use every day in your social or business correspondence.

Nevertheless, you’re letting yourself in for ten minutes of real trouble, for you will be working with fifty particularly difficult spelling words. So put on your thinking cap before you begin.

A half-dozen high school teachers who took this test were able to make an average score of only five proper choices. Can you do better? Six or seven right is _very good_, eight or nine right is _excellent_, and 100 per cent success marks you as an absolute expert in English spelling.
